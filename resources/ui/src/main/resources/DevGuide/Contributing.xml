  <content>We're always looking for contributions! Here are some ways to participate in the continuous improvement of PhenoTips:&#xd;
&#xd;
{{toc numbered="true"/}}&#xd;
&#xd;
= Give us your Feedback =&#xd;
&#xd;
Do you have a great idea? Just tell us! Send your feedback to the [[users mailing list>>Contact.Mailing Lists]]. The feedback could be also about something that does not work, something that could be improved, a feature you'd like to see, etc. Or simply it could be that you're a happy user. Letting us know that helps a lot!&#xd;
&#xd;
= Spread the word =&#xd;
&#xd;
Do you like PhenoTips? Spread the word about it! In any way you would prefer, like tweets, blogs, articles, talks at conferences, discussion with colleagues, etc.&#xd;
&#xd;
= Help other users =&#xd;
&#xd;
Have you gained some experience with PhenoTIps? How about sharing your experience with others? Answer emails on the [[user mailing list>>Contact.Mailing Lists]].&#xd;
&#xd;
= Testing =&#xd;
&#xd;
Test new PhenoTips versions and report bugs on [[GitHub>>https://github.com/phenotips/phenotips/issues]].&#xd;
&#xd;
{{comment}}&#xd;
= Documentation =&#xd;
&#xd;
Not satisfied with the documentation? You have 2 options:&#xd;
&#xd;
* Report what you think should be improved by [[creating a JIRA issue for it>>http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XINFRA]]&#xd;
* Look at the [[Documentation Guide]] and help us improve it. One difficulty is to find the right location for new documentation. So here are a few tips:&#xd;
** Add explanations on how to use PhenoTips to the related [[Features guide pages>>Features.WebHome]]&#xd;
** Add development explanations to the related [[Developer guide's pages>>DevGuide.WebHome]]&#xd;
** Add configuration and administration explanations to the related [[Administration guide's pages>>AdminGuide.WebHome]]&#xd;
** Add other explanations to the [[FAQ>>FAQ.WebHome]]&#xd;

&#xd;

&#xd;
Are you looking for a place to start? Look at our [[open issues in our Issue Tracker>>https://github.com/phenotips/phenotips/issues]].&#xd;
&#xd;
== Code acceptance criteria ==&#xd;
&#xd;
There are a number of criteria that your code will be judged on:&#xd;
&#xd;
* Whether it works and does what is intended. This one is probably obvious!&#xd;
* Whether it fits with the spirit of the project. Some code may be rejected as they take the project in a different direction from that which the current development community has chosen. This is usually discussed on an issue well before the code is contributed. So if you are unsure about submitting some code please discuss it there or on the mailing lists first. Feel free to continue discussing it (with new justification) if you disagree, or appeal to a wider audience on the mailing lists.&#xd;
* Whether it contains tests. It is expected that code relating to functionality will be accompanied by unit tests and/or integration tests. It is strongly desired (and will be requested) for bug fixes too, but will not be the basis for not applying it. At a bare minimum, the change should not decrease the amount of automated test coverage. As a community, we are focusing on increasing the current coverage, as there are several areas that do not receive automated testing.&#xd;
* Whether it contains documentation. All new functionality needs to be documented for users, even if it is very rough for someone to expand on later. While rough is acceptable, incomplete is not. As with automated testing, as a community we are striving to increase the current coverage of documentation.&#xd;
&#xd;
Above all, don't be discouraged. These are the same requirements the current committers should hold each other to as well. And remember: your contributions are always welcome!&#xd;
&#xd;
== Coding rules ==&#xd;
&#xd;
If you submit code you need to follow these rules:&#xd;
&#xd;
* Put the correct [[Copyright>>License||anchor="HCopyright"]] in the files.&#xd;
* Ensure that your code passes the [[build>>Building]]. {{info}}The build contains some Checkstyle checks that your code must pass.{{/info}}&#xd;
* Ensure that you have unit tests and/or integration tests.&#xd;
* Use the same code formatting as the existing code.&#xd;
* Create a [[Pull Request>>https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request]].&#xd;
* Create [[documentation>>Contributing||anchor="HDocumentation"]] for what you have added.&#xd;
&#xd;
If you plan to contribute large amount of code that impact existing code, we recommend discussing it on the mailing list first.</content>
