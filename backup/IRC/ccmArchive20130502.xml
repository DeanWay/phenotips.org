15:47 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hey vshivam, mfiume's here
15:47 &lt;vshivam> Yeah hi :)
15:47 &lt;vshivam> I did receive an email from him.
15:47 &lt;sdumitriu1> OK
15:49 &lt;vshivam> mfiume: I suppose, I wont be able to fill in details about the Project Timeline / Architecture since we haven't yet zeroed down on the idea.
15:50 &lt;vshivam> I'll provide in detail, my skill sets and previous projects.
15:52 &lt;vshivam> *zeroed down on the disease
15:55 &lt;mfiume> Hi cshivam, those are the most important details at this time, yes
15:55 &lt;mfiume> vshivam*
15:57 &lt;vshivam> Thanks.
15:57 &lt;mfiume> the architecture will involve 1) creating a reliable communications link between the mobile device and the biometric sensing unit, 2) receiving, formatting, and storing the relevant data 3) presenting the data to the user in a way that is aesthetically pleasing, interpretable, and relevant 4) creating analytics components on the server-side to compute trends in the data and (potentially) 5) developing a web-based dashboard for users and clinicians to acce
15:58 &lt;mfiume> you may wish to expand / elaborate on these if you have your own ideas
15:58 &lt;vshivam> hm.
15:58 &lt;vshivam> Yeah, I have a few,
15:58 &lt;mfiume> feel free to compare to bantapp.com to make ideas more concrete
15:59 &lt;vshivam> I'll add on to these.
15:59 &lt;vshivam> sure.
15:59 &lt;mfiume> safeheart.ca is also something analogous that we're veloping
15:59 &lt;mfiume> developing*
16:00 &lt;vshivam> Yeah. I was thinking of putting this as an idea.
16:01 &lt;vshivam> I mean, monitoring for Health Diseases
16:01 &lt;vshivam> for Heart Patients
16:02 &lt;vshivam> We could also sync the mobile device with a blood pressure monitor
16:02 &lt;vshivam> if feasible
16:03 &lt;vshivam> and it could give useful insights for cardiovascular diseases.
16:04 &lt;krinye> has joined #ccm
16:05 &lt;mfiume> take a look at http://www.scanadu.com
16:05 &lt;mfiume> 'at home' biometric devices seem to be gaining popularity
16:07 &lt;vshivam> Yeah. I read a few research papers about the same.
16:11 &lt;vshivam> Scanadu is awesome
16:12 &lt;vshivam> It'd be pretty great to work on something on similar lines

16:28 &lt;BogdanVancea> Hello everyone!
16:29 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hi Bogdan
16:29 &lt;sdumitriu1> Do you need Marc?
16:30 &lt;BogdanVancea> sdumitriu1, do you have a few minutes to possibly discuss my proposed architecture and timeline for the Solr backend project?
16:30 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
16:30 &lt;BogdanVancea> yay
16:31 &lt;BogdanVancea> I was thinking I'd first create a set of repository interfaces to encapsulate all the data access logic
16:32 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
16:32 &lt;BogdanVancea> Then proceed to create a first set of implementations for these repository interfaces and migrate all the current data access logic from within the managers there.
16:32 &lt;sdumitriu1> Currently there are SQL queries scattered throughout the code
16:32 &lt;sdumitriu1> Those should be replaced by API calls
16:32 &lt;sdumitriu1> Exactly
16:33 &lt;BogdanVancea> yep, I have browsed the code these last few days
16:33 &lt;BogdanVancea> after finishing up cleaning the current code
16:33 &lt;BogdanVancea> I would create implementations for the Solr backend
16:33 &lt;BogdanVancea> which would actually be classes implementing the same repository interface
16:33 &lt;mfiume> has joined #ccm
16:34 &lt;BogdanVancea> so the Manager classes will not be aware they are using Solr or ICE objects, they just call the interfaces
16:34 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yep
16:35 &lt;BogdanVancea> Then proceed to write to some performance tests
16:35 &lt;BogdanVancea> tbh, I've only tested Solr systems using SolrMeter
16:36 &lt;BogdanVancea> to observe performance evolution with regard to scaling
16:36 &lt;BogdanVancea> so I'm not exactly sure how the tests should look
16:36 &lt;BogdanVancea> but I'm thinking the actual query time is important
16:36 &lt;BogdanVancea> for the performance
16:36 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
16:37 &lt;BogdanVancea> Perhaps a comparison between the query times and the size of the data, you did mention that was the first reason ICE was chosen.
16:37 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
16:38 &lt;BogdanVancea> Cool :)
16:38 &lt;sdumitriu1> The size will also depend on how much we want to store
16:39 &lt;sdumitriu1> Solr can index without storing, which might give us an even better size than ICE
16:39 &lt;sdumitriu1> But then we might want to be able to retrieve everything back, which means that we'll have both the index and the actual data
16:40 &lt;BogdanVancea> I see.
16:41 &lt;BogdanVancea> Do you know, approximatly, some numbers regarding the data currently stored by MedSavant?
16:42 &lt;BogdanVancea> I havent been able to populate my local db instance with data.
16:42 &lt;sdumitriu1> I think several gigabytes, with hundreds of millions of records
16:42 &lt;sdumitriu1> mfiume: Is that correct?
16:42 &lt;sdumitriu1> mfiume: We need some sample data for students
16:43 &lt;BogdanVancea> There an exeption deliberatly set in the code stopping me to download the data.
16:43 &lt;BogdanVancea> and I didn't remove it because of a comment there about someone being charged money ;))
16:43 &lt;BogdanVancea> But hunders of millions of records sounds awesome
16:43 &lt;BogdanVancea> I haven;t worked with some many records
16:43 &lt;BogdanVancea> :D
16:43 &lt;BogdanVancea> yet
16:44 &lt;mfiume> That stoppage doesnt relate to the main dataset
16:45 &lt;mfiume> Sample datasets are in .vcf format
16:45 &lt;mfiume> and can be downloaded from here, for example: ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/paper/
16:45 &lt;BogdanVancea> Thank you :)
16:46 &lt;mfiume> ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/release
16:46 &lt;mfiume> As you can see, they can be very large: ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov//1000genomes/ftp/release/20110521/ALL.chr1.phase1_release_v3.20101123.snps_indels_svs.genotypes.vcf.gz
16:47 &lt;mfiume> A description of the format is here: http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-variant-call-format-version-41
16:47 &lt;BogdanVancea> Hm..., it seems I cannot access the links
16:48 &lt;BogdanVancea> Might be my dorm internet has some closed ports.
16:50 &lt;mfiume> Perhaps
16:50 &lt;mfiume> theyre working for me :(
16:50 &lt;mfiume> has left #ccm
16:51 &lt;BogdanVancea> I just check on my phone, the links are working on mobile data traffic.
16:51 &lt;BogdanVancea> so its my internet
16:51 &lt;BogdanVancea> :)
16:54 &lt;BogdanVancea> 10.7 GB
16:54 &lt;BogdanVancea> wow
16:54 &lt;BogdanVancea> cool
16:54 &lt;BogdanVancea> :D
16:56 &lt;BogdanVancea> Anyway, I was thinking to dedicate about 4-6 weeks to testing alone
16:56 &lt;BogdanVancea> so I can try more versions for the solr schema
16:57 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yep
16:58 &lt;sdumitriu1> Different types of indexers and query parsers
16:58 &lt;BogdanVancea> yep
16:58 &lt;BogdanVancea> there's a lot of tinkering that can be done there
16:59 &lt;BogdanVancea> I would also like to try testing the performance on a solr cluster
17:00 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes, sharding is important
17:00 &lt;sdumitriu1> Actually the most important
17:00 &lt;BogdanVancea> I see :)
17:00 &lt;BogdanVancea> Is the current ICE backend sharded?
17:01 &lt;BogdanVancea> I mean, have you tried that on your servers?
17:01 &lt;sdumitriu1> No, that's another proposed GSoC project
17:01 &lt;BogdanVancea> I see
17:01 &lt;BogdanVancea> :)
17:04 &lt;BogdanVancea> Thank you Marc and Sergiu, for your time and feedback :)
17:04 &lt;sdumitriu1> You're welcome
17:04 &lt;BogdanVancea> The Solr part sounds like its gonna be interesting :D
17:05 &lt;BogdanVancea> I'll go finish up my application then.
17:05 &lt;BogdanVancea> have a nice evening, good bye
17:05 &lt;sdumitriu1> Bye
