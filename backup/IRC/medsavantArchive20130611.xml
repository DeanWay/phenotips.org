11:59 &lt;sdumitriu> Hello bvancea
12:00 &lt;bvancea> hello sdumitriu
12:00 &lt;bvancea> how are you?
12:01 &lt;sdumitriu> A bit bummed that I can't get an Windows8 machine to boot Linux
12:01 &lt;bvancea> hmm
12:01 &lt;bvancea> because of the loader?
12:01 &lt;sdumitriu> No idea
12:02 &lt;sdumitriu> UEFI doesn't find my bootloader
12:02 &lt;sdumitriu> And I tried a bunch
12:02 &lt;sdumitriu> I'll keep trying when I get back home
12:03 &lt;bvancea> is it a your personal machine?
12:03 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
12:03 &lt;bvancea> nice
12:03 &lt;bvancea> laptop?
12:03 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
12:05 &lt;bvancea> sucks that you're having so many problems with the dual boot
12:07 &lt;sdumitriu> I'm trying even mono boot
12:07 &lt;sdumitriu> But now it can't boot anything
12:08 &lt;bvancea> that's weird
12:08 &lt;bvancea> what model is it?
12:14 &lt;sdumitriu> http://www.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/product/samsung-samsung-series-7-13-3-ultrabook-silver-intel-core-i5-3337um-256gb-ssd-8gb-ram-windows-8-np740u3e-a02ca/10238261.aspx?path=609cedec812f495f65ab1e7534666052en02&amp;SearchPageIndex=1
12:17 &lt;bvancea> hmm, looks nice
12:17 &lt;bvancea> I've heard trying to disable secure boot might bricks some series of samsung laptops
12:17 &lt;bvancea> brick*
12:18 &lt;sdumitriu> No, that worked fine
12:18 &lt;sdumitriu> I can boot from an external USB stick
12:19 &lt;bvancea> I see
12:19 &lt;bvancea> well, hopefully you can get it to boot
12:19 &lt;bvancea> what dist are you using?
12:28 &lt;sdumitriu> Gentoo
12:29 &lt;bvancea> nice
12:29 &lt;bvancea> I've used Ubuntu mostly
12:29 &lt;bvancea> but the last few versions made me sad
12:30 &lt;bvancea> not even to the laptop fan works properly
12:33 &lt;bvancea> anyway, I've connected to the ICE database on the dev server
12:34 &lt;bvancea> could seem to get the medsavant client to connect to it
12:34 &lt;bvancea> and trying to export the database didn't get me far
12:34 &lt;bvancea> the community edition for infobright doesnt support insert/update/delete
12:35 &lt;sdumitriu&gt; It should
12:35 &lt;bvancea> not sure how people are supposed to use it
12:35 &lt;sdumitriu> What did you try to do?
12:35 &lt;bvancea> for the database? or the medsavant client?
12:36 &lt;sdumitriu> For the database
12:36 &lt;bvancea> connected using mysql workbench
12:36 &lt;bvancea> exported one of the databases into an .sql file
12:36 &lt;bvancea> and then tried to import it locally
12:36 &lt;bvancea> both from the command line client
12:36 &lt;bvancea> and mysql workbench
12:37 &lt;bvancea> apparently it should only work if you're loading one file at a time, in bulk
12:38 &lt;marta> has left #medsavant
12:39 &lt;marta> has joined #medsavant
14:19 &lt;bvancea> its so weird I can't find an infobright database back-up script atleast
14:19 &lt;bvancea> I guess there's more people using the enterprise edition
14:20 &lt;sdumitriu> Or there's nobody using any edition...
14:21 &lt;bvancea> could be
14:33 &lt;bvancea> I wonder if I could maybe access the database from my local server
14:35 &lt;bvancea> I mean, if I try to connect my local server engine to that database
14:35 &lt;bvancea> is the database only accessible over ssh?
14:37 &lt;sdumitriu> I doubt it
14:37 &lt;sdumitriu> I think it
14:37 &lt;sdumitriu> 's firewalled
14:44 &lt;bvancea> hmm
14:44 &lt;bvancea> I'll try to install a trial of the enterprice edition
14:45 &lt;sdumitriu> But wait
14:45 &lt;bvancea> hm?
14:45 &lt;sdumitriu> If you have the database dump, can't you just import it into a simple mysql instance?
14:45 &lt;sdumitriu> Forget about ICE
14:46 &lt;bvancea> hmm
14:46 &lt;sdumitriu> The only advantage is that it compresses data
14:46 &lt;bvancea> okay, I'll try that
14:46 &lt;sdumitriu> But it's still a MySQL
14:46 &lt;bvancea> I see
14:46 &lt;bvancea> I thought it has extra stuff
15:12 &lt;bvancea> yay, it works
15:12 &lt;sdumitriu> :)
15:12 &lt;bvancea> now I just need to find the database with the most information
15:12 &lt;bvancea> there's like 30-40 databases there
15:13 &lt;bvancea> should I ask on the development list which is the most populated?
15:14 &lt;sdumitriu> No, that's not quite development
15:14 &lt;sdumitriu> Ask Marc
15:15 &lt;bvancea> okay, I'll send an email to him
15:15 &lt;sdumitriu> But I guess you can take one randomly for the moment, and look into it
15:15 &lt;bvancea> I opened like 10 of them
15:16 &lt;bvancea> and took the dumps to those which seemed to have both patients and variants
15:16 &lt;bvancea> I have 2 dumps
15:16 &lt;bvancea> but one has 1 patient, the other has 4
15:17 &lt;bvancea> well,it might suffice
