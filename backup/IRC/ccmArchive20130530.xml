13:10 &lt;marta> remember your early experiments with ctakes + the human phenotype ontology?
13:11 &lt;ravigarg27> yup went through those in these two days
13:11 &lt;marta> could you make the code available somewhere? i'd like to play with it a little bit to figure out what works and what doesn't for recognition of hpo terms
13:12 &lt;ravigarg27> sure should I mail it to you?
13:13 &lt;marta> well, you could commit it on github :)
13:13 &lt;marta> just make a new repo for it in your account
13:14 &lt;ravigarg27> okay
13:14 &lt;ravigarg27> will ping you as soon as I complete it
13:14 &lt;marta> thanks
13:20 &lt;marta> BogdanVancea: you'll soon have access to a couple of machines at our lab where you can play with a distributed solr
13:20 &lt;BogdanVancea> hello marta
13:20 &lt;BogdanVancea> awesome
13:20 &lt;BogdanVancea> :D
13:22 &lt;marta> it should have been done sooner, but waaaay too many people take their vacation in may :-|
13:23 &lt;BogdanVancea> hehe
13:23 &lt;BogdanVancea> isn't august the month when everyone's taking a vacation?
13:58 &lt;marta> here everyone feels an urge to run away as soon as the school year ends
14:13 &lt;BogdanVancea> school year already ended there?
14:14 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
14:14 &lt;sdumitriu1> For a while
14:14 &lt;BogdanVancea> oh, I see

14:17 &lt;BogdanVancea> hehe
14:19 &lt;BogdanVancea> I still have a month and 1 week until my bachelor exam
14:20 &lt;BogdanVancea> sort of a short summer
14:21 &lt;sdumitriu1> But you're done with the code and the written disertation, right?
14:22 &lt;BogdanVancea> pretty much
14:22 &lt;BogdanVancea> advisor keeps reading
14:22 &lt;BogdanVancea> I keep changing
14:23 &lt;BogdanVancea> but it's pretty much done :)
14:29 &lt;BogdanVancea> even though I don't have to actually work for the bachelor project now, I can't wait to finish up with it
