02:22 &lt;ruthgrace> hey @sdumitriu, I have this process that respawns if I kill it. the process is called mysqld and the user is called mysql.
02:22 &lt;ruthgrace> Do  you know how to kill this process?
02:22 &lt;ruthgrace> I have tried kill -TERM PID (this makes the process respawn)
02:24 &lt;ruthgrace> and also mysqladmin -u root -p shutdown (it didn't find the mysqld  to shut down)
02:24 &lt;ruthgrace> and also mysqladmin -u mysql -p shutdown
02:24 &lt;ruthgrace> and got
02:24 &lt;ruthgrace> Warning: /usr/local/infobright/bin/mysqladmin: unknown variable 'loose-local-infile=1' Enter password:  /usr/local/infobright/bin/mysqladmin: connect to server at 'localhost' failed error: 'Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql-ib.sock' (2)' Check that mysqld is running and that the socket: '/tmp/mysql-ib.sock' exists!
02:26 &lt;ruthgrace> I also keep getting the login failed error when I try to use MedSavant
02:27 &lt;ruthgrace> by mvn install the shared, server, client, running the server engine .jar with -c medsavant.properties , and running the client .jar
02:35 &lt;ruthgrace> I changed both mysql and mysqld-ib root passwords to the same thing, so I'm wondering if I'm unable to log on because of that process I can't kill
02:36 &lt;ruthgrace> Maybe the MedSavantServerEngine is using that one, and I don't have the password for it since the user is mysql and not root?

20:16 &lt;Shubham> Hi !
20:16 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi Shubham
20:16 &lt;sdumitriu> I looked at your application
20:17 &lt;sdumitriu> It needs much more details in the Architecture part
20:17 &lt;sdumitriu> That is the most important part of the application
20:18 &lt;sdumitriu> It's the one that convinces the mentors that you're devoted to the project and that you're capable of implementing it
20:18 &lt;Shubham1> has joined #ccm
20:18 &lt;dev__&gt; has joined #ccm
20:19 &lt;sdumitriu> It should contained detailed plans for the project
20:19 &lt;sdumitriu> What happens, when and why
20:20 &lt;sdumitriu> Shubham1: Not sure if you got all of that, check http://phenotips.org/IRC/ccmArchive20140320
20:22 &lt;Shubham1> Thanks, I'll work on making it more elaborate. Anything other than that ?
20:23 &lt;sdumitriu> The rest looks good
20:24 &lt;sdumitriu> Oh, something else
20:24 &lt;sdumitriu> You should already start studying the research papers, so that you get a better understanding of the required work
20:25 &lt;sdumitriu> I mean the paper and code referenced in the project description
20:32 &lt;Shubham> has joined #ccm
