11:51 &lt;sdumitriu> Hey bvancea
11:52 &lt;bvancea> hey sdumitriu
11:52 &lt;bvancea> what's up?
11:55 &lt;gauravsaini03> has joined #phenotips
11:55 &lt;sdumitriu> Just got back to the office, catching up
11:55 &lt;bvancea> I see :)
11:56 &lt;bvancea>  I pushed another commit to my pull request, not sure I got the correct field for the groups. Check when you have time :P
11:56 &lt;sdumitriu> Yep
11:57 &lt;bvancea> I'm currently thinking of what analytics I can do for the GSOC project
11:59 &lt;bvancea> Seems like xwiki has some nice charts modules which can be used for graphs and stuff
11:59 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
12:00 &lt;sdumitriu> That started as my first GSoC
12:00 &lt;bvancea> I see
12:01 &lt;bvancea> I found two official ones, but this Charting plugin seems to wrap the charting macro extension.
12:01 &lt;bvancea> Any of them your work?
12:03 &lt;sdumitriu> Any "plugin" is deprecated
12:03 &lt;sdumitriu> And there are two macros
12:04 &lt;sdumitriu> One is a Radeox macro, which is also deprecated
12:04 &lt;sdumitriu> And one is a wiki macro
12:04 &lt;sdumitriu> The plugin and older macro were mine
12:05 &lt;sdumitriu> The new one is more limited in what it supports, though
12:05 &lt;bvancea> I see
12:08 &lt;bvancea> Well, the only one I found that is modified in 2014 is this one: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Chart+Macro
12:08 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes, that's the new one
12:09 &lt;bvancea> I see
12:09 &lt;bvancea> cool
12:09 &lt;bvancea> :D

14:42 &lt;akats> Autosave.js didn't overwrite the default one. Could you check if I put it in the right folder? The default is in resources/js/xwiki/editors/ and I put my file in distribution/war/src/main/webapp/resources/js/xwiki/editors/
14:43 &lt;sdumitriu> Remove webapp
14:45 &lt;akats> It's good
14:45 &lt;akats> You can pull
14:45 &lt;sdumitriu> Works lovely :)
14:46 &lt;sdumitriu> You didn't push
14:47 &lt;sdumitriu> Or wait...
14:48 &lt;sdumitriu> Removing webapp is wrong, it should work like this
14:50 &lt;akats> Oh yeah, hard refresh struck again.

16:36 &lt;bvancea> hey sdumitriu
16:36 &lt;sdumitriu> Hey bvancea
16:36 &lt;bvancea> I noticed you we're working on the Medsavant integration for phenotips
16:37 &lt;bvancea> how does phenotips store variant information for patients?
16:37 &lt;sdumitriu> It doesn't, right now it relies on MedSavant
16:37 &lt;bvancea> hm
16:38 &lt;bvancea> but it doesn't store any information at all, like what variants are associated with what patient?
16:38 &lt;bvancea> or are the patient records shared with medsavant?
16:53 &lt;CARAM> has quit
16:53 &lt;akats> has left #phenotips
16:54 &lt;akats> has joined #phenotips
16:56 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: Can I use data-bind in the UI? I want to put the object id of the remote server configuration into the data-bind when it is shown to the user in the list of available search engines.
16:58 &lt;akats> has quit
18:44 &lt;CARAM> has quit
18:54 &lt;sdumitriu> bvancea: No, MedSavant stores all the information about variants
18:55 &lt;bvancea> I see.
18:55 &lt;sdumitriu> What our bridge does instead is make sure the patient's external ID is the same as the sample ID in the VCF when uploading
18:56 &lt;bvancea> So do we want to be able to manually assign variants to patients? Or just to parse the VCF files ?
