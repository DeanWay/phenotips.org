  <content>&lt;marta> has joined #medsavant
07:25 &lt;bvancea> has joined #medsavant
08:29 &lt;bvancea> hey sdumitiru
08:29 &lt;bvancea> sdumitriu*
09:37 &lt;sdumitriu> Hey bvancea
09:39 &lt;bvancea> how are you?
09:39 &lt;sdumitriu> Tired
09:39 &lt;sdumitriu> I need a vacation
09:39 &lt;bvancea> hehe
09:40 &lt;bvancea> when was the last time you had a vacation?
09:49 &lt;sdumitriu> 2009?
09:50 &lt;bvancea> wow
09:50 &lt;bvancea> props to you for lasting so long
11:23 &lt;sdumitriu> So, how's it going?
11:23 &lt;sdumitriu> Done with the thesis rewrite?
11:27 &lt;bvancea> yup, I've send it to the advisor
11:28 &lt;bvancea> I'm working on that abstraction layer now
11:29 &lt;bvancea> if I manage to finish that up and set up debugging for the new generated project version
11:29 &lt;bvancea> I'll consider it a productive weekened
11:29 &lt;bvancea> weekend*
11:30 &lt;bvancea> I also had the final graduation festivity this morning :)
11:30 &lt;bvancea> I'm not sure why my university likes to hold 2 separate graduation festivities
11:30 &lt;bvancea> a lot of redundancy imo
11:34 &lt;bvancea> I mean there's a festivity with all the faculties at the university, and there's the festivity with my year only
12:42 &lt;bvancea> has joined #medsavant
13:36 &lt;bvancea> so I have a question
13:37 &lt;bvancea> after we would create a query object
13:37 &lt;bvancea> and populate it with parameters, etc
13:37 &lt;bvancea> and query.execute() is called
13:38 &lt;bvancea> the object should have delegate the execution of the query to a QueryExecutor (I'm using the terminology from XWiki)
13:38 &lt;bvancea> how are we going to do that?
13:39 &lt;bvancea> I can only think of using dependency injection to inject a query executor into queries
13:39 &lt;bvancea> or just singleton query executors
13:39 &lt;bvancea> and have the query implementations call them
14:37 &lt;bvancea> I create a new issue for the code I've been working on
14:37 &lt;bvancea> hopefully the name is descriptive enough
14:41 &lt;sdumitriu> bvancea: Sorry, I was talking with somebody
14:41 &lt;bvancea> its okay
14:41 &lt;bvancea> its saturday anyway
14:41 &lt;bvancea> :)
14:41 &lt;sdumitriu> So yes, the QueryExecutor is the one that will be different: SolrQueryExecutor, ICEQueryExecutor
14:42 &lt;bvancea> I see
14:42 &lt;sdumitriu> DI would be a good idea, except that MedSavant doesn't have one
14:42 &lt;sdumitriu> So the next best idea is to use a Factory
14:42 &lt;sdumitriu> Which uses a simple if..else based on a text configuration file
14:43 &lt;sdumitriu> It's not that pretty, but it works
14:43 &lt;bvancea> hmm
14:44 &lt;bvancea> so the factory would read the classname for that executor and instantiate one?
14:44 &lt;bvancea> from the config file I mean
14:45 &lt;sdumitriu> Reflection is one idea, indeed
14:45 &lt;sdumitriu> And it's more scalable
14:46 &lt;bvancea> cool
14:46 &lt;bvancea> what exactly do you mean by more scalable though?
14:47 &lt;sdumitriu> What I said was to just have an if (configuration.engine == "solr") then executor = new SolrQueryExector() else executor = new IceQueryExecutor()
14:47 &lt;sdumitriu> Which isn't scalable
14:49 &lt;bvancea> I understand
14:49 &lt;bvancea> but why exactly is reflection more scalable?
14:49 &lt;sdumitriu> If we add a new query executor, we don't need to change the if
14:50 &lt;sdumitriu> It's enough to include a new jar in the classpath and set the right classname in the configuration
14:50 &lt;bvancea> hm, yes
14:50 &lt;bvancea> :D
14:51 &lt;bvancea> thats was better
14:52 &lt;bvancea> that's way better*
15:21 &lt;bvancea> http://www.ohloh.net/orgs/apache/projects?query=&amp;sort=committer_count
15:21 &lt;bvancea> we were talking a few days ago about commiters on apache
15:22 &lt;bvancea> I wonder how accurate that page is
15:33 &lt;sdumitriu> Well, that column shows only committers active in the last 12 months, not all time
15:34 &lt;sdumitriu> And there's an important difference to take into account: git shows authors, SVN shows committers
15:34 &lt;sdumitriu> Which varies gratly
15:34 &lt;sdumitriu> greatly
15:37 &lt;sdumitriu> You should set a real usename on your local git
15:37 &lt;sdumitriu> Not Xenosky
16:05 &lt;bvancea> yeah, sorry about that
16:05 &lt;bvancea> I do have it set though
16:05 &lt;bvancea> but I think the IDE overwrites it
16:05 &lt;bvancea> not sure why</content>
