13:11 &lt;sdumitriu> Hey aw1231
14:47 &lt;tian2992> hello
15:27 &lt;Shubham> has quit
15:41 &lt;Shubham> has quit
15:55 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi tian2992
15:56 &lt;tian2992> sdumitriu: hi, I was checking out phenotips
15:56 &lt;tian2992> for GSoC
15:56 &lt;tian2992> I was trying to work on https://github.com/phenotips/phenotips/issues/756
15:56 &lt;tian2992> but I can't find where is the list actually fetched
15:57 &lt;tian2992> I found https://github.com/phenotips/phenotips/blob/master/components/patient-data/ui/src/main/resources/PhenoTips/UIX_Field__phenotype.xml and the PhenoTips.YesNoNAPicker component
15:57 &lt;sdumitriu> Did you try Firebug or other Developer Tools?
15:57 &lt;tian2992> I'm still building phenotips so I don't have it running yet
15:59 &lt;sdumitriu> So, to make sure you're looking for the right thing, "Suggested terms" refers to the "You might want to check for..." area, for example on http://playground.phenotips.org/bin/edit/data/P0000060#HClinicalsymptomsandphysicalfindings
16:01 &lt;tian2992> ohh
16:04 &lt;tian2992> so it is related to the DiffDiagnosisService
16:05 &lt;Shubham> has quit
16:10 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
16:11 &lt;tian2992> I see now that it is connected to _service.getDifferentialPhenotypes
16:12 &lt;tian2992> but there I see both the hpoa Predictor and PhenotypeMappingScriptService.java
16:12 &lt;tian2992> yet I don't see the implementation
16:13 &lt;tian2992> ohh, I see the AbstractPredictor.java has it
16:14 &lt;sdumitriu> You're on the right track
16:14 &lt;tian2992> I got a Failed to execute goal org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-tool-packager-plugin:5.4.2:import (default) on project database-zip: Execution default of goal org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-tool-packager-plugin:5.4.2:import failed: A required class was missing while executing org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-tool-packager-plugin:5.4.2:import: Lorg/sonatype/aether/RepositorySystemSession;
16:15 &lt;tian2992>  when building on my machine
16:16 &lt;sdumitriu> You need to use Maven 3.0
16:16 &lt;tian2992> I'm using maven 3.2.1
16:16 &lt;sdumitriu> That's a bug in one of the Maven plugins we use, it doesn't work with recent versions of Maven
16:16 &lt;tian2992> should I downgrade?
16:16 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
16:16 &lt;tian2992> oh, ok
16:17 &lt;ruthgrace> has quit
16:22 &lt;mcupak> has quit
16:23 &lt;sdumitriu> Cool, somebody's improving the documentation
16:23 &lt;sdumitriu> Thank you tian2992
16:23 &lt;tian2992> i'm Sebsatian Oliva ;P
16:23 &lt;sdumitriu> Yeah, figured out
16:29 &lt;Shubham> has quit
16:57 &lt;ruthgrace> has quit
17:12 &lt;Shubham> has quit
17:16 &lt;tian2992> I don't know, as ICPredictor seems to be filtering for Phenotypes in getPhenotypesWithAnnotation
17:23 &lt;ruthgrace> has quit
17:30 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: So I ran into a little dilemma on my end. The version of HTTPClient that is currently used by phenotips is 4.2.5. Some of the basic parts that I need from it are now deprecated, and the latest version does them in a different way (for example instantiating the client).  Should I stick with the 4.2.5 or introduce 4.3.2/4.3.3?
17:33 &lt;sdumitriu> I wonder if 4.3 is backwards compatible
17:33 &lt;sdumitriu> Meaning that other parts of XWiki use 4.2, and maybe third party libraries use 4.2
17:34 &lt;sdumitriu> Check the release notes
17:34 &lt;sdumitriu> They usually say if it's compatible or not
17:34 &lt;akats> ok one sec
17:35 &lt;aw1231> sdumitriu: hey, sorry I keep missing you.  Are you available?
17:35 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
17:36 &lt;aw1231> Good.  So, I am just having trouble grasping the scope of the project, and i am honestly probably missing something obvious.
17:41 &lt;aw1231> What exactly is the project supposed to accomplish during the summer?
17:41 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: I don't see it in the release notes. Would it be terrible to have both? Is that even possible, actually? But if I had to guess, I'd say they are compatible. http://www.apache.org/dist/httpcomponents/httpclient/RELEASE_NOTES-4.3.x.txt
17:45 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes, they look compatible
17:45 &lt;sdumitriu> A few classes are deprecated, but not removed
17:45 &lt;sdumitriu> So you should just update
17:46 &lt;sdumitriu> aw1231: Can you wait a few more minutes?
17:46 &lt;sdumitriu> I'm in the middle of a discussion
17:46 &lt;aw1231> Sure
17:51 &lt;Shubham> has quit
18:17 &lt;Shubham> has quit
18:23 &lt;sdumitriu> aw1231: Sorry, this discussion is taking longer...
18:24 &lt;aw1231> It's fine,  I might have to go here shortly though
18:59 &lt;sdumitriu> aw1231: Still here?
19:00 &lt;sdumitriu> tian2992: How's it going?
19:02 &lt;tian2992> sdumitriu: I saw the IC predictor, and it seems to implement getPhenotypesWithAnnotation properly
19:02 &lt;sdumitriu> Let me check
19:41 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: I think I found a privacy issue in the server response specifications
