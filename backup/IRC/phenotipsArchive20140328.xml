12:27 &lt;akats> Beat it. But it's not really nice, because it loads eagerly rather than lazily.

13:26 &lt;bvancea> yeah
13:26 &lt;bvancea> had a couple of deadlines

13:28 &lt;bvancea> wow, that is a quite a schedule
13:29 &lt;bvancea> phenotips/phenome-central?
13:29 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
13:33 &lt;sdumitriu> I just sent this an hour ago: http://mail.phenotips.org/pipermail/devs/2014-March/000079.html
13:34 &lt;sdumitriu> If you could lend a hand, that would be wonderful
13:34 &lt;bvancea> sure
13:43 &lt;bvancea> any new feature you want me to check?
13:44 &lt;sdumitriu> Not particularly, just hammer at it until it breaks
13:44 &lt;bvancea> okay :))
13:51 &lt;bvancea> should I be able to access a hidden patient case if I'm not logged in?
13:55 &lt;sdumitriu> No
13:55 &lt;sdumitriu> Unless you created it
13:55 &lt;sdumitriu> (as guest)
13:56 &lt;bvancea> Hmmm
13:56 &lt;bvancea> Well, this is what I did
13:56 &lt;bvancea> I created a patient as admin
13:57 &lt;bvancea> changed ownership to a bogus user : 22222222
13:57 &lt;bvancea> logged out
13:57 &lt;sdumitriu> Hm...
13:57 &lt;bvancea> searched for P00000 in the search bar
13:57 &lt;sdumitriu> That's a bug
13:57 &lt;bvancea> and I can see the patient
13:57 &lt;bvancea> even though its hidden
14:05 &lt;bvancea> everything else seems fine
14:05 &lt;bvancea> I'll go have dinner and have another look

16:05 &lt;bvancea> Hey sdumitriu
16:05 &lt;bvancea> I've found another small issue
16:05 &lt;sdumitriu> Hey again
16:05 &lt;sdumitriu> Shoot
16:06 &lt;bvancea> When editing a patient record, in the section Clinical symptoms and physical findings
16:07 &lt;bvancea> if you search for something on the quick phenotipe search
16:07 &lt;bvancea> then you check the checkbox this patient is clinically normal
16:07 &lt;bvancea> you get a residual result window
16:07 &lt;bvancea> that doesn't go away by clicking outside
16:07 &lt;bvancea> its pretty minor
16:10 &lt;sdumitriu> I see
16:10 &lt;sdumitriu> There's a "hide suggestions" link in the top right corner, you know
16:10 &lt;sdumitriu> Although nobody seems to see it
16:10 &lt;sdumitriu> Bottom right too
16:16 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: would you like to take a look at what I have?
