11:24 &lt;fabiocba> hello
11:26 &lt;fabiocba> I am a brazilian student interested in gsoc
11:26 &lt;fabiocba> and in particular, these two projects "Big Data backend for MedSavant" and "Development of machine learning methods for modeling the evolution of tumors"
11:27 &lt;fabiocba> is there anyone else interested in developing these ideas during this summer?
11:31 &lt;fabiocba> last summer I developed a project using Hadoop at University of Waterloo
11:34 &lt;fabiocba> I was selected as a master candidate here in Brazil and I intend to work with machine learning on big data
11:39 &lt;fabiocba> I am very enthusiastic about ML methods and I also have worked with C++ a lot during my years of under-graduate, so I think these projects match my skills and interests
12:36 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi fabiocba
12:36 &lt;fabiocba> hello sdumitriu
12:36 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes, both projects seem to be very popular
12:37 &lt;fabiocba> ok, but is there anything already defined?
12:38 &lt;sdumitriu> What do you mean by "defined"?
12:40 &lt;fabiocba> maybe a student of yours
12:40 &lt;sdumitriu> Oh, I see
12:41 &lt;sdumitriu> I have no idea, I'm an org admin and a mentor for PhenoTips related projects
12:41 &lt;sdumitriu> I think there is a strong candidate for the MedSavant project, but I don't know about the tumors project
12:42 &lt;sdumitriu> You should contact the mentors by mail, at the contact address listed under each project
12:44 &lt;fabiocba> Ok, great
12:44 &lt;fabiocba> that's what I was looking to know
12:44 &lt;fabiocba> thanks
12:45 &lt;fabiocba> maybe if they already have someone in mind, it's not worth to submit a proposal
12:46 &lt;sdumitriu> Well, they don't have someone specific in mind, the best candidate wins
12:47 &lt;fabiocba> I see
12:47 &lt;sdumitriu> I'm just saying that so far there is a good student, we don't know if you're better or not
12:48 &lt;fabiocba> Ok, thanks sdumitriu
12:48 &lt;sdumitriu> You're welcome
