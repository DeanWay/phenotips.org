11:12 &lt;IJessa> sergiu?
11:20 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
11:20 &lt;sdumitriu> I'll bee at the office soon
11:21 &lt;sdumitriu> IJessa: Tests are working?
11:22 &lt;IJessa> they're working but there is a lot of bugs
11:23 &lt;IJessa> is there a way to run the xwiki server just standalone without running the tests?
11:25 &lt;sdumitriu> WDYM?
11:25 &lt;sdumitriu> target/package/start.sh
11:40 &lt;IJessa> thanks
11:41 &lt;IJessa> it worked
11:55 &lt;sdumitriu> IJessa: Change of plans, I'm not going to be there today
11:55 &lt;sdumitriu> Ask here if you have other questions
11:58 &lt;IJessa> the only think is a lot of the build is missing which is kinda making it hard to test, the measurements, genotype info and all the phenotype info are all missing so i'm stuck at a point where I can't really continue since all of the rest of the tests depend on the inputed phenotype info
11:58 &lt;sdumitriu> OK, I'll work on fixing that today
12:00 &lt;IJessa> thanks
