11:24 &lt;Guest38811> do u know if it is still of priority?
11:24 &lt;sdumitriu> The secret for a successful GSoC is never to propose critical projects :)
11:24 &lt;Guest38811> the mailing list seems to be inactive
11:25 &lt;sdumitriu> So all the proposed projects are important, but none are critical
11:25 &lt;sdumitriu> It's better to select good students than important projects
11:26 &lt;sdumitriu> Anyway, that one is the most popular project, so the competition is high
11:26 &lt;sdumitriu> And I've seen your email
11:26 &lt;sdumitriu> It
11:27 &lt;sdumitriu> It's just that we're all trying hard to finish something else right now, we'll answer soon
11:27 &lt;sdumitriu> You do know that teamwork is forbidden, right?

15:10 &lt;Csine> YAY
15:10 &lt;Csine> first time really using IRC its pretty niffy
15:10 &lt;Csine> havent used it since middle school
15:11 &lt;Csine> I have a few questions about some of the project and was wondering if it was possible to talk about them here
15:13 &lt;Csine> has joined #ccm
15:14 &lt;Csine> Sorry got D/c
15:15 &lt;sdumitriu> Csine: Depends what projects
15:16 &lt;Csine> I was looking at the Development of machine learning methods for modeling the evolution of tumors
15:16 &lt;Csine> it sounds interesting and it falls pretty well at what I'm studying
15:16 &lt;ohotin> has joined #ccm
15:20 &lt;sdumitriu> CCM is an umbrella organization for different projects, and only some of them use IRC; unfortunately that project is not on IRC
15:21 &lt;sdumitriu> Quaid provided some details yesterday, make sure you didn't look at it before that
15:21 &lt;sdumitriu> There are links to the existing code and a paper describing the method
15:22 &lt;sdumitriu> If you've looked at those and have more specific questions, you should send an email to Quaid (his email is in the project description)
15:22 &lt;Csine> Ahh I see thank you!~
15:23 &lt;sdumitriu> You're welcome
