10:43 &lt;bhargavgolla> Hi, I was trying to send a mail to dev@phenotips.org asking for questions regarding two project ideas. But, my mail was rejected my mailserver. Should I subscribe to the mailing list before posting to it?
10:43 &lt;gauravsaini03> yes bhargavgolla you have to subscrbie
10:44 &lt;bhargavgolla> Just found the link when I was exploring phenotips.org
10:44 &lt;bhargavgolla> Thanks for that
10:48 &lt;bhargavgolla> has left #phenotips

11:09 &lt;nclandrei> hi everyone
11:09 &lt;nclandrei> anyone around? (-:
11:09 &lt;gauravsaini03> hello nclandrei
11:09 &lt;sdumitriu> No, we're all squares
11:09 &lt;nclandrei> hahahahahaha
11:10 &lt;gauravsaini03> :P
11:10 &lt;nclandrei> back with some feedback, if someone can chat a little :D
11:10 &lt;allasm> hello
11:12 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: So xwiki already has a nice rest interface in place! http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/XWikiRESTfulAPI#HCreatinganXWikiObject
11:17 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
11:17 &lt;sdumitriu> But it's low level
11:18 &lt;sdumitriu> You're dealing with raw objects and properties, not with patient data
11:19 &lt;nclandrei> so I'm presenting here my ideas/ feedback, whenever someone is free, please tell me if I'm doing it right :) so, I have installed the program and ran it, adding some patients
11:19 &lt;nclandrei> exporting and so on
11:20 &lt;nclandrei> first of all, the interface is very good, the feedback from the central database regarding diseases is extremely fast, so congratulations
11:21 &lt;nclandrei> and I kind of have another point of view regarding multiple visits, collaborating on certain cases
11:23 &lt;nclandrei> should I express my idea? :D
11:23 &lt;sdumitriu> Sure
11:26 &lt;nclandrei> well everyone who uses Phenotips has the possibility to choose if he/ she wants that data to be public or private
11:26 &lt;nclandrei> even private, you can choose to have some collaborators, so we have 3 cases
11:26 &lt;nclandrei> the case when it is private and without any collaborator is not of interest in this case
11:26 &lt;nclandrei> so we are left with the other two cases
11:27 &lt;nclandrei> when we have a new patient in the database of a user and the user selects
11:27 &lt;nclandrei> that he/ she wants to have collaboratos or set it as public data
11:28 &lt;nclandrei> we shall store the information about that patient either on his PC or on the central XWiki database
11:28 &lt;nclandrei> and set a flag
11:28 &lt;nclandrei> so we can basically work with that patient from that let's call it virtual server
11:29 &lt;nclandrei> so the virtual server posseses information regarding all the patients who will have their data public, and we will keep that server on the FIRST user's PC/ central database
11:35 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: true enough
11:36 &lt;sdumitriu> akats: What?
11:37 &lt;sdumitriu> nclandrei: You might have started with a false premise
11:37 &lt;sdumitriu> Users don't have PhenoTips locally
11:37 &lt;sdumitriu> There's one installation per institution
11:37 &lt;akats> That it's too low level. We don't have any current rest implementations correct?
11:38 &lt;akats> If not should I then make a separate module or just put it inside appropriate existing modules?
11:39 &lt;sdumitriu> But there is some truth in your conclusion, coming up is a new feature to "Push to PhenomeCentral", which will share a patient record local to the institution to the central patient repository available at phenomecentral.org
11:40 &lt;sdumitriu> Coming up in a more distant future is federated logins and the ability to connect PhenoTips users and share patients not onyl with users on the same instance, but with any user (based on OpenID or WebID or another federated authentication)
11:41 &lt;nclandrei> okay then, so from there, on phenomcentral.org we can make a certain layout for the patient so that anyone allowed can see
11:41 &lt;nclandrei> the last updates, visits and the ability of changing certain things
11:42 &lt;sdumitriu> akats: Not yet, put them in separate submodules of the module they belong to, like components/patient-data/rest
11:42 &lt;akats> Ok
11:48 &lt;nclandrei> @sdumitriu: so what do you say?
11:49 &lt;gauravsaini03> has quit
11:53 &lt;sdumitriu> nclandrei: OK
11:54 &lt;nclandrei> is this a good start? :D
11:56 &lt;sdumitriu> I'm not sure yet...
11:57 &lt;nclandrei> so what should I do from now onwards? should I play around more with Phenotips and maybe come with a different solution or improve this one?
11:57 &lt;nclandrei> I mean before the application starts
11:59 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: are we going to save through REST?
12:07 &lt;sdumitriu> akats: Yes
12:07 &lt;sdumitriu> nclandrei: You need to have an outstanding application before the student application period ends
12:08 &lt;sdumitriu> So you can start preparing it
12:08 &lt;sdumitriu> https://gsoc.ccm.sickkids.ca/GoogleSummerOfCode/StudentApplicationTemplate
12:08 &lt;nclandrei> oh, outstanding sounds so scary haha
12:09 &lt;nclandrei> how many people do you expect to apply for your projects? will there be a huge competition?
12:09 &lt;sdumitriu> So play with the idea until you get a good detailed architecture and roadmap
12:10 &lt;sdumitriu> Not huge, but tight
12:10 &lt;nclandrei> can I also use your info? regarding the phenomcentral.org?
12:11 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
12:11 &lt;nclandrei> excellent
12:11 &lt;nclandrei> so I can start researching.. if I have any other ideas/ questions, I shall return here :)
12:11 &lt;nclandrei> thanks
12:11 &lt;sdumitriu> nclandrei: Did you look at the "history" of a patient record?
12:15 &lt;nclandrei> like family/prenatal etc. histories?
12:15 &lt;nclandrei> or the history of the entire record?
12:27 &lt;sdumitriu> 2nd
12:30 &lt;sdumitriu> http://pheno.tips/
12:49 &lt;akats> If I'm adding a brand new module, is there a way to include it into the existing built standalone instance without rebuilding everything?
12:49 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes, just copy the jar from target/ to webapps/phenotips/WEB-INF/libs
12:50 &lt;akats> Ok then there's something wrong with the code
13:47 &lt;akats> got it
13:47 &lt;akats> but I have no idea what the problem was

15:01 &lt;akats> There currently exists no alternative to X
15:01 &lt;akats> Xwikidocument for adding objects to a doc?
15:02 &lt;fabiocba> has quit
15:02 &lt;akats> As far as I understand documentModelBridge is not capable
15:02 &lt;sdumitriu> No
15:02 &lt;akats> So what happens once they manage to come up with something better?
15:02 &lt;akats> We rewrite?
15:03 &lt;sdumitriu> We'll have to migrate the code
15:03 &lt;akats> Ok
15:03 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes

15:30 &lt;anishshah101___> hey
15:30 &lt;anishshah101___> i am interested in doing with Phenotips
15:30 &lt;anishshah101___> The idea which got me interested is Mobile web interface for Phenotips
15:31 &lt;anishshah101___> needed some pointers to get started
15:31 &lt;anishshah101___> interested in doing GSOC 2014
15:37 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi anishshah101___
15:37 &lt;anishshah101___> hi
15:44 &lt;anishshah101___> could you suggest me a few pointers to get started with the project idea?
15:44 &lt;sdumitriu> https://gsoc.ccm.sickkids.ca/GoogleSummerOfCode/FirstSteps
15:46 &lt;anishshah101___> thanks for the link
15:51 &lt;akats1> sdumitriu: do we have "xwiki" as a constant somewhere? Or in configuration files?
15:51 &lt;sdumitriu> No
15:52 &lt;akats1> Ok
16:25 &lt;anishshah101___> has quit
17:12 &lt;akats1> we don't need xml as an output for the rest server?
17:12 &lt;akats1> just json is fine?
17:13 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
17:35 &lt;IonelPopescu> has joined #phenotips
18:08 &lt;nclandrei> sdumitriu: can I for example try to solve some posted bugs?
18:09 &lt;nclandrei> so I can have a closer look at the code and interact with it a little
18:15 &lt;nairboon> has quit
18:45 &lt;sdumitriu> nclandrei: Sure
19:04 &lt;akats1> has quit
19:18 &lt;IonelPopescu> has quit

19:51 &lt;nclandrei> but now it's too late, tomorrow I have classes and work :D I'll come back tomorrow evening with more feedback
19:51 &lt;nclandrei> yes
19:53 &lt;nclandrei> I think in Canada it's lunch/ afternoon, so have a good day
