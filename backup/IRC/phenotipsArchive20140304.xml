10:35 &lt;nclandrei> hi everyone
11:08 &lt;IonelPopescu> has joined #phenotips
11:13 &lt;sdumitriu_[Away]&gt; is now known as &lt;sdumitriu>
11:13 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi nclandrei
11:15 &lt;nclandrei> a bit later in the evening, can I send you a small draft of how the proposal would look like?
11:15 &lt;nclandrei> :)
11:17 &lt;sdumitriu> Sure

11:50 &lt;akats> So I'm doing some cleaning up, and I just pushed whatever changes I made working on the REST server. Though you might want to have the link https://github.com/soLEED/phenotips-1/commit/3a7fdff148bb48fcfc296b0c1b64644c369274a9
11:53 &lt;pradeeban1> has quit
12:10 &lt;akats> So can the phenomecentral repo compile into standalone, or do I have to put it into a the phenotips standalone
12:11 &lt;sdumitriu> standalone should have everything
12:11 &lt;akats> ok
12:26 &lt;akats> On your computer do you have the version in phenotips-parent pom set as 1.0-milestone-10 or 1.0-SNAPSHOT?
12:28 &lt;sdumitriu> SNAPSHOT
12:29 &lt;akats> well... phenomecentral would not build until I changed the phenotips-parent pom to version 1.0-milestone-10
12:31 &lt;sdumitriu> Hm...
12:31 &lt;sdumitriu> What was the error?
12:32 &lt;akats> Couldn't find the pom
12:32 &lt;akats> the phenotips-parent
12:34 &lt;vishnu93> has joined #phenotips
12:38 &lt;akats> I like the front page design
12:41 &lt;puneet_> has quit
12:49 &lt;SayAsh> hi I have a question to ask?
12:49 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi SayAsh, I guess you do
12:50 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: so right now the registration form does not create a new user. Where does the request go? Somebody's email?
12:50 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
12:50 &lt;sdumitriu> That is a custom form, not the registration
12:50 &lt;sdumitriu> The goal is to replace it with your code
12:51 &lt;SayAsh> ya, I want to know that we have to create a mobile application for phenotips or just a website interface that would work with mobile appropriately?
12:51 &lt;sdumitriu> akats: Just pushed an update to the pom to make the build work
12:52 &lt;akats> sdumitiu: And I'm assuming I should do that with an adapter which would create a new user
12:52 &lt;akats> sdumitiu: thanks
12:52 &lt;IonelPopescu> has quit
12:52 &lt;sdumitriu> SayAsh: Not an application, just a skin for the website
12:53 &lt;SayAsh> ok
12:54 &lt;SayAsh> and the template for it would like what it is given in this page http://phenotips.org/UserGuide/GettingStarted  right?
12:56 &lt;SayAsh> and as you said just a skin for the website, then i think that u want that to work with both desktop and mobile browsers?
12:56 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes, one flexible skin for every browser
13:02 &lt;reid_a> has quit
13:26 &lt;SayAsh> i have a doubt. In the "measurements" section for the patient information each time we enter a new entry. What I am thinking that the information which will going to remain same throughout should fill up automatically as a user clicks on "new entry". isn't it?
13:27 &lt;sdumitriu> How do you know it should remain the same?
13:28 &lt;sdumitriu> It's misleading data, unless the user clears it, it would seem that the doctor actually measured stuff and the numbers there are validated, which isn't the case
13:38 &lt;SayAsh> ok, still what i am trying to convey is like take the eg of sitting height, then the length of arm and hand, that will going to remain same throughout the patient's life unless anything sever happens. So like these type of fields can be filled automatically though there would be an access to change those figures too in new entry if they had got change. This will going to save the time for the person who is filling. The weight and the height will be changin
14:01 &lt;IonelPopescu> has joined #phenotips
14:12 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: I should not include the xwikipreferences file in the commits, because I'm assuming it will overwrite whatever settings there already are?
14:12 &lt;sdumitriu> You should, but with care

15:05 &lt;IonelPopescu> has joined #phenotips
15:12 &lt;SayAsh> has quit
15:21 &lt;akats> So the registerinline template is overriden by XWiki/Registration
15:22 &lt;akats> it's a fairly extensive document
15:22 &lt;akats> I can include the current register page into it, which would take me some time
15:23 &lt;akats> or I could include createUser() into the current Phenomecentral registration page
15:35 &lt;vishnu93> has quit
15:58 &lt;gauravsaini03> has quit
16:08 &lt;akats> What should be the id of the xwiki document for the new user? There is no username. Should I put the email address? That is guaranteed to be unique. For example for admin it's xwiki:XWiki.Admin
16:09 &lt;sdumitriu> No email address
16:10 &lt;sdumitriu> The login won't work
16:10 &lt;sdumitriu> You need to add the username field in the registration form
16:11 &lt;akats> and then check for it's uniqueness
16:11 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
16:12 &lt;sdumitriu> I guess the default registration page does that already
16:12 &lt;sdumitriu> It has some live validation in it, you should reuse it
16:12 &lt;akats> There's a macro if I remember correctly
16:12 &lt;akats> Live as in javascript?
16:12 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
16:12 &lt;akats> ok
16:26 &lt;pradeeban> has quit
16:38 &lt;akats> How would I change the document's (id?) from xwiki:data.WebHome to xwiki:XWiki.Username. document.rename() doesn't want to play nice. Is there another method, that would not require me to work with XWikiDocument rather than just Document?
16:38 &lt;akats> That smiley is :d
16:38 &lt;akats> :\d
16:39 &lt;akats> without the \
16:39 &lt;sdumitriu> I don't see smileys, they're disabled
16:39 &lt;sdumitriu> (for me)
16:39 &lt;sdumitriu> I don't understand the question
