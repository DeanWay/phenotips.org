13:28 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: I'm having a problem with tomcat or url rewriting. I have a a js script loaded with jsfx and I get this error
13:28 &lt;akats> "NetworkError: 404 Not Found - https://matchmaker.phenotips.org/resources/js/remote%2Dmatching/main.js"
13:30 &lt;sdumitriu1> Right
13:30 &lt;sdumitriu1> I have to fix that
13:31 &lt;sdumitriu1> How about now?
13:34 &lt;akats> Sweet. It worked. Thank you
13:35 &lt;akats> By the way, I remember a long time ago Marta saying that I shouldn't worry about the UI
13:35 &lt;akats> So it's still not presentable
13:35 &lt;akats> Just letting you know
13:49 &lt;sdumitriu1> You've missed the chance to meet the new underling
14:02 &lt;akats> Oh damn.
14:02 &lt;akats> When was he here?
14:02 &lt;akats> Yesterday?
14:02 &lt;akats> If I knew I wouldn't have been working on the logos :(
14:07 &lt;akats> By the way, does Phenotips send stuff to monarchinitiative.org
14:08 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
14:10 &lt;akats> Is there a mechanism for sorting out fake reports?
14:10 &lt;sdumitriu1> ?
14:10 &lt;akats> Well as is I'm testing stuff out, with reports that aren't real, and I can see them being sent to monarchinitiative
14:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> That's OK
14:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> That's just a service
14:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> It computes a score based on inputs
14:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> It doesn't care about the data
14:15 &lt;akats> Ooh, I see. The testing so far isn't very successful, so I'm looking through the packets
14:18 &lt;akats> Does phenotips keep a log?
14:19 &lt;sdumitriu1> What kind of log?
14:19 &lt;sdumitriu1> You have /var/log/tomcat6/catalina.out on p3
14:19 &lt;akats> Ok. I'll check it out
14:27 &lt;akats> If I wanted to send a request from p3 server to itself, would I need to set up an alias?
14:28 &lt;akats> in hosts that is
14:28 &lt;sdumitriu1> You can't
14:30 &lt;akats> Oh...
14:31 &lt;akats> Well, I can't really think of any other way of testing, because I haven't been able to connect to my computer at sickkids from p3 either
14:33 &lt;akats> Wait, I can't set up an alias or I can't send requests from p3 to p3?
14:36 &lt;sdumitriu1> From p3 to p3 you can
14:37 &lt;sdumitriu1> But why would you do that?
14:38 &lt;sdumitriu1> You need another public IP to test agains
14:38 &lt;sdumitriu1> t
14:38 &lt;akats> I want to see if the remote matching works. Sending requests from p3 to sick kids doesn't work. Sending request from my computer at sick kids to p3 also doesn't work. So I want to at least see if I can send requests from p3 to p3.
14:39 &lt;akats> I feel like there's no point setting up another server before I can see that p3 to p3 works
14:40 &lt;akats> Or am I mistaken here?
14:47 &lt;akats> Is phenotips1 where the main phenotips.org is?
14:54 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
15:33 &lt;vijay13> has quit
15:50 &lt;akats> Does solr need to work properly for wiki.getDocument?
16:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> No
16:42 &lt;akats> Do you think I would be able to set up remote debugging for tomcat on p3?
16:48 &lt;sdumitriu1> You could
16:48 &lt;sdumitriu1> But you need to forward the socket through combine
16:49 &lt;akats> Oh god. Should I just work on this issue for now https://github.com/phenotips/phenotips/issues/942? Seems a little bit more urgent
16:52 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes, please
19:33 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: did the functionality in issue 942 ever work?
20:02 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
20:06 &lt;akats> Even for phenotypes that are already present in the left side panel?
20:06 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
20:36 &lt;akats> I was reading the comment for this commit. Could it be that it is the culprit? https://github.com/phenotips/phenotips/commit/7ef68dc8eb68663bbedd73e14399bc77b8903819
20:38 &lt;akats> I'm sorry. I'm not thinking straight. I'll just uncomment the line and try it.
20:41 &lt;akats> Yeah, nevermind that wasn't it
21:14 &lt;akats> Well, I still haven't found it. All I can really say is that clicking on NO (in the quick search) works. And that yes and no have different behaviors (different functions executed onClick) https://github.com/phenotips/phenotips/blob/master/components/patient-data/ui/src/main/resources/PhenoTips/PatientSheetCode.xml#L1003
21:53 &lt;akats> Good news.
21:54 &lt;sdumitriu1> Found the problem?
21:54 &lt;akats> I've got a possible fix. See if you're ok with it, and I'll finish it up. https://github.com/antonkatz/phenotips-1/compare/phenotips:master...antonkatz:issue-942?expand=1
21:56 &lt;akats> I'm going home now. If this is urgent, let me know and I'll work on it tomorrow, if not I'll do it monday.
21:56 &lt;sdumitriu1> What happens if you click on the label of the term?
21:57 &lt;sdumitriu1> Not on Y, but the rest of the suggestion
21:57 &lt;akats> Nothing. That's what I mean by finishing it up
21:58 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hm, it should work, but it still doesn't explain why it stopped working
21:58 &lt;akats> I was about to say that
21:58 &lt;sdumitriu1> I think the problem lies elsewhere, this is just patchwork
21:58 &lt;akats> The comments point to that idea
21:59 &lt;akats> I know where A problem lies
21:59 &lt;akats> But I went though git history and didn't see anything
21:59 &lt;sdumitriu1> Check out the commits for #600
22:00 &lt;sdumitriu1> Although this is recent...
22:00 &lt;sdumitriu1> The problem should have been in M12
22:02 &lt;akats> Everything works fine as long as the phenotype is not in the predetermined list
22:03 &lt;akats> It that doesn't work because when the suggestion is picked it takes on the value of the existing yes/no picker in the predetermined list
22:07 &lt;akats> Indeed, 600 doesn't seem to be it.
22:07 &lt;akats> Good night
