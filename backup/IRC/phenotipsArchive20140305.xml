11:13 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: A user is just a document with a user object attached to it; there is nothing else I need to do for xwiki to consider it a user?
11:13 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
11:14 &lt;akats> Hmm...
11:25 &lt;SayAsh> Is it mandatory to solve issues for getting selected in GSOC?
11:26 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: Live validation doesn't actually check for a username being taken
11:26 &lt;sdumitriu> SayAsh: There are open easy issues: https://github.com/phenotips/phenotips/issues?labels=easy&amp;page=1&amp;state=open
11:26 &lt;sdumitriu> akats: Hm, that's bad
11:27 &lt;sdumitriu> But we can implement it
11:27 &lt;akats> I knew you were going to say that.
11:27 &lt;akats> I'm on it
11:27 &lt;sdumitriu> SayAsh: I
11:27 &lt;sdumitriu> I'm a bit busy right now, will answer soon
11:31 &lt;SayAsh> fine
11:58 &lt;gauravsaini03> has joined #phenotips
12:17 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: in prototype there is a way to disable a DOM element so that it cannot be selected later with $$()
12:17 &lt;sdumitriu> Not that I know of
12:17 &lt;akats> hm...
12:17 &lt;sdumitriu> Why?
12:18 &lt;akats> I can't seem to select a &lt;span>, event though it's there. Interestingly enough, it is set to display:block but is not visible
12:19 &lt;akats> And I'm seeing code like element.disabled in the xwiki javascript

14:51 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: Can the message be green?
14:51 &lt;sdumitriu> Validation message?
14:52 &lt;sdumitriu> As in "yay, you managed to find an unused username"?
14:53 &lt;akats> Yes! Ok. I'll figure out how to make it red
14:53 &lt;sdumitriu> You should be able to make it green
14:53 &lt;sdumitriu> I think it's not supposed to be a "validation error"
14:54 &lt;akats> So what you are saying is that I can leave it green
14:55 &lt;sdumitriu> Wait...
14:55 &lt;sdumitriu> I thought you asked me if you can turn it green
14:55 &lt;sdumitriu> Which you can
14:55 &lt;sdumitriu> What's going on there?
15:00 &lt;sdumitriu> http://localhost:8080/bin/edit/PhenoTips/PatientSheetCode?editor=object&amp;classname=XWiki.JavaScriptExtension&amp;object=14
16:21 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: theres no gitignore in phemocentral repo by the way
16:22 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes, you should add one
16:24 &lt;akats> can I just put into master instead of creating a new branch
16:25 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
16:49 &lt;akats> So I made the commit. I'm not ready to pull yet, because I want to rebuild the whole thing and see it if works. Also I need to make another pull request first for the gitignore. I don't know if I can do all of it today, so I'll just give you the link to the commit for now. https://github.com/soLEED/phenomecentral.org/commit/6a87fbdeebf744eda4c558f84c8c76320b05d773

21:09 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi
21:10 &lt;aw1231> I was wondering, what does the application look like?  Is it free form response? Or is it pick-and-choose?
21:11 &lt;aw1231> The GSOC application, I mean
