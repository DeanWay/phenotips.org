18:09 &lt;nclandrei> hi everyone
18:09 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi nclandrei
18:09 &lt;nclandrei> how are things going?
18:09 &lt;sdumitriu> Same
18:10 &lt;nclandrei> I've started to go through bugs :D I wanted to get a better insight into the code
18:10 &lt;nclandrei> my hands are getting "dirty" haha
18:10 &lt;sdumitriu> Any luck?
18:11 &lt;nclandrei> hmm so fac no, I'm working on the case with suggested terms suggests non-phenotype terms
18:11 &lt;nclandrei> so far*
18:11 &lt;nclandrei> but I think I finally got the good wire
18:11 &lt;sdumitriu> Oh, that one..
18:12 &lt;sdumitriu> It's not quite an easy one
18:12 &lt;nclandrei> yes, I know, but I thought it wouldn't be so hard
18:12 &lt;nclandrei> I was mistaken... haha
18:12 &lt;nclandrei> have you got a look into it? any suggestions?
18:13 &lt;sdumitriu> No, I didn't
18:13 &lt;sdumitriu> I guess the quickest thing to do is to filter in the Java code terms that don't have HP:0000118 as ancestor
18:14 &lt;nclandrei> mhm.. I saw that suggestion on the issue tracker
18:14 &lt;nclandrei> I was going to open it again anyway
18:50 &lt;nclandrei> awesome.. yes, it seems better, even though it didn't completely solve the problem
18:50 &lt;nclandrei> it still gives me some testing-errors
18:50 &lt;nclandrei> I'll continue tomorrow, it's already 1 am here :(
