12:41 &lt;natani> sdumitriu: hey, I want to contribute to the org. can you guide me through the steps needed to be followed?
12:42 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hi natani
12:43 &lt;sdumitriu1> As part of GSoC?
12:44 &lt;natani> Yes :)
12:44 &lt;sdumitriu1> Excellent
12:45 &lt;sdumitriu1> Did you find something interesting in 2013's list of project ideas?
12:47 &lt;natani> yes, actually I was thinking to contribute to an organization which works in the area of  high performance computing, I saw the project list and found the project titled as Parallelization of Queries in MedSavant interesting. But I don't know much about the project that's why I want to know more about the organization and it's works.
12:56 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hold on a bit, debugging something
12:57 &lt;natani> Sure
13:04 &lt;sdumitriu1> So, while the CCM does handle a bit of HPC, I wouldn't say that it is an organization that's a good host for HPC projects, in the broad sense
13:05 &lt;sdumitriu1> The MedSavant parallelization was selected this year, and the project was successful
13:07 &lt;sdumitriu1> But we can find some ideas for you
13:07 &lt;natani> ok, fine so what all projects do you have which are in your todo list? may be I can find something to contribute to.. :)
13:10 &lt;sdumitriu1> Strictly HPC, or general ideas
13:14 &lt;natani> General ones, keeping HiPC aside, my purpose for doing GSoC this year is more for open source contribution, I am anyway doing my research in HPC. So if the goal of having a good experience of open source contribution is achieved, I will be more than happy.
13:15 &lt;sdumitriu1> So what's your level? BSc, Msc?
13:16 &lt;natani> I am in my pre-final/third year of B.Tech. (Computer Science).
13:16 &lt;sdumitriu1> Good
13:17 &lt;sdumitriu1> Do you prefer Java, Mobile apps, or Web?
13:17 &lt;natani> Web or java both are ok. I have no experience with mobile apps development.
13:18 &lt;sdumitriu1> This is an interesting project: https://gsoc.ccm.sickkids.ca/GoogleSummerOfCode/Multiple+visits+support+in+PhenoTips
13:18 &lt;sdumitriu1> What do you think about it?
13:24 &lt;natani> ok, I got the second and the third point, that these functionalities can be added. But how can the new visit be unnamed ? as they allow to track different versions saved for the same patients. Anyway, the project looks good.
13:25 &lt;natani> Did you propose it for GSoC 2014?
13:35 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
13:36 &lt;natani> So how should I start contributing?
13:36 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hold on, debugging something else
14:00 &lt;sdumitriu1> So, first step is to stick around
14:01 &lt;sdumitriu1&gt; Since that project is about PhenoTips, you should learn more about it
14:01 &lt;sdumitriu1> Read the documentation available at http://phenotips.org/
14:02 &lt;sdumitriu1> Especially the developer resources http://phenotips.org/DeveloperResources/
14:02 &lt;sdumitriu1> (not that many now, though...)
14:03 &lt;sdumitriu1> You should try to get the sources, build the project, and run it to see how it works
14:04 &lt;natani> Ok, I will read and try it and get back to you. It's 4:30 AM here in my country, I should go to sleep now. By the way , thanks a lot. See you tomorrow.
14:08 &lt;sdumitriu1> Good night natani, see you tomorrow
23:03 &lt;natani> has joined #ccm
23:41 &lt;natani> I am trying to build the project using $ mvn install and get the error like:  http://paste.ubuntu.com/6462634/</content>
