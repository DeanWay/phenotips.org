12:33 &lt;BogdanVancea> Hello everyone, any mentors around?
12:35 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi BogdanVancea
12:35 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
12:37 &lt;BogdanVancea> hello
12:37 &lt;BogdanVancea> I have some question regarding the Solr backend for medsavant
12:38 &lt;BogdanVancea> project*
12:40 &lt;sdumitriu> Go ahead
12:40 &lt;BogdanVancea> okay
12:41 &lt;BogdanVancea> I've browsed through the source code
12:41 &lt;BogdanVancea> for MedSavant that is
12:42 &lt;BogdanVancea> the services I've found are all defined in the serverapi package
12:44 &lt;BogdanVancea> the new classes should basically replace the ones present and remove all hard the hard coded parts?
12:46 &lt;BogdanVancea> I've also noticed the project lists Maven and Git experience as nice to have skills, but the code on the svn repo is composed of several netbeans projects
12:47 &lt;BogdanVancea> does this mean that I would need to migrate the build process to maven?

12:50 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> has joined #ccm
12:57 &lt;sdumitriu> BogdanVancea: Yes, the idea is to replace hard-coded queries
12:57 &lt;sdumitriu> No, you don't need to migrate the build yourself, this is something that we're currently working on
12:59 &lt;BogdanVancea> I see, thanks
13:02 &lt;BogdanVancea> I've also attempted to build the MedSavant server locally
13:03 &lt;BogdanVancea> Is there a database dump available somewhere so I can play with it a little?
13:21 &lt;BogdanVancea> I need to go now, I'll come back later or tomorrow with some more question. Good bye!
13:25 &lt;sdumitriu> BogdanVancea: I'll try to get one available

14:23 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> has joined #ccm
14:23 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> So what was the issue ?

14:25 &lt;sdumitriu> The issue is that when doing mvn install a second time, you're re-adding stuff to the database
14:25 &lt;sdumitriu> Since it doesn't start with a new, empty database
14:25 &lt;sdumitriu> Now the database passes correctly

14:41 &lt;sdumitriu> You can try
14:41 &lt;mfiume> has joined #ccm
14:41 &lt;sdumitriu> Alternatively you should download the file separately using a client that can resume if the download is interrupted
14:42 &lt;sdumitriu> http://nexus.cs.toronto.edu/nexus/content/groups/public/org/xwiki/enterprise/xwiki-enterprise-web/4.5.1/xwiki-enterprise-web-4.5.1.war

14:44 &lt;sdumitriu> kushalkhandelwal: Same error?
14:44 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Same error
14:45 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> But now i know the problem
14:45 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> i tried to open the link with the browser
14:45 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> my college proxies set a restriction on the file size
14:45 &lt;sdumitriu> Ah
14:45 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> so I cannot download a size greater then a particular limit

16:00 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> did that
16:04 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> No errors detected
16:04 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> what should i do next
16:04 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> sdumitriu:
16:05 &lt;sdumitriu> Hm...
16:05 &lt;sdumitriu> Did you sudo again?
16:05 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I did sudo
16:06 &lt;sdumitriu> Don't do that
16:06 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I initially started with sudo
16:06 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> so now when i do mvn clean install
16:06 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> it wont be able to clean
16:06 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> because my target was build with sudo privliges
16:06 &lt;sdumitriu> sudo chown -R kushal .
16:06 &lt;sdumitriu> Then mvn clean install
16:08 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> downloading all files again
16:09 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> so when i used sudo mvn install where were the dependencies downloaded ?
16:11 &lt;sdumitriu> Error unpacking file [/root/.m2/repository/org/xwiki/enterprise/xwiki-enterprise-web/4.5.1/xwiki-enterprise-web-4.5.1.war]
16:11 &lt;sdumitriu> So in /root/.m2
16:12 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Ok
16:13 &lt;sdumitriu> As a rule, you should very rarely use sudo
16:13 &lt;sdumitriu> Don't use it unless you're asked to
16:13 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> so if i copy the dependencies from there and change the owner it should work
16:13 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Yup
16:14 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I should not have started with the sudo
16:17 &lt;vshivam> has joined #ccm
16:28 &lt;sdumitriu> kushalkhandelwal: Any progress?
16:42 &lt;vshivam> Hi Sdumitriu
16:42 &lt;vshivam> I am interested in working for the
16:42 &lt;vshivam> Mobile Application for chronic disease management
16:42 &lt;vshivam> on the Android Platform
16:43 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi vshivam
16:43 &lt;vshivam> I think this'll be the start of the project or has any work been done
16:43 &lt;vshivam> on the application ?
16:44 &lt;sdumitriu> This is a new application
16:44 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> sdumitriu: Still downloading dependencies
16:44 &lt;vshivam> I checked out the details on the ideas page.
16:45 &lt;vshivam> Can you tell me something more about the project ? The ideas that we are looking at
16:46 &lt;vshivam> a few basic features that the application is expected to have
16:47 &lt;sdumitriu> It's supposed to be something like http://www.bantapp.com/
16:50 &lt;vshivam> oh okay. I'll just check it out.
16:52 &lt;vshivam> Is this app supposed to associated to some particular disease ?
16:53 &lt;vshivam> The one that is proposed
16:53 &lt;vshivam> like Bant App ?
16:54 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
16:54 &lt;sdumitriu> You can't have something generic for more than one disease
16:55 &lt;vshivam&gt; yeah
16:55 &lt;vshivam> Diabetes or something else ?
17:00 &lt;kushalk124> has joined #ccm
17:02 &lt;vshivam> If we know the disease I'll probably have some more idea regarding the features to put in the app
17:03 &lt;vshivam> or are we not finalised on it yet ?
17:06 &lt;sdumitriu> It's very open ended at the moment
17:10 &lt;vshivam> hm.
17:11 &lt;vshivam> Is there a way I can get started on this project ?
17:11 &lt;vshivam> I have experience working with Android Applications
17:11 &lt;sdumitriu> You should talk with Marc
17:11 &lt;sdumitriu> But he's off for today
17:12 &lt;sdumitriu> What timezone are you in?
17:12 &lt;vshivam> India
17:12 &lt;vshivam> utc+530
17:13 &lt;sdumitriu> OK, try tomorrow a bit earlier
17:13 &lt;vshivam> Okay. Thanks

17:18 &lt;camelia_> Hello! I have a question, please: which package contains classes QueryManager and Query?
17:20 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi camelia_
17:20 &lt;sdumitriu> Here's a trick
17:20 &lt;sdumitriu> Go to https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/
17:20 &lt;sdumitriu> Press t
17:21 &lt;sdumitriu> Which opens the file locator
17:21 &lt;sdumitriu> Then start typing QueryManager
17:29 &lt;sdumitriu> camelia_: Found it?

18:35 &lt;camelia_> has joined #ccm
18:36 &lt;camelia_> I tried a XWQL query provided in the documentation where doc.creationDate > '2008-01-01'
18:37 &lt;camelia_> and I got the following error:ERROR o.h.u.JDBCExceptionReporter    - incompatible data types in combination
18:37 &lt;camelia_> and the caught exception in the component: Exception while execute query. Query statement = [ select doc.fullName from XWikiDocument as doc where doc.creationDate > '2008-01-01' ]
18:39 &lt;camelia_> is the date in an inappropiate format?
18:39 &lt;sdumitriu> You should pass a real date as a parameter
18:39 &lt;sdumitriu> Not hard-coded
18:46 &lt;sdumitriu> $xwiki.queryManager.xwql("where doc.date > :date").bindValue('date', $xwiki.jodatime.getDateTime(2013, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0).toDate()).execute()
18:46 &lt;sdumitriu> Anyway, since that example is on xwiki.org, then it used to work at some point, I wonder when did it stop working...
19:04 &lt;vshivam> has joined #ccm
19:20 &lt;camelia_> ok, I managed to execute the query now . Thank You !

23:17 &lt;sdumitriu> Great
23:17 &lt;sdumitriu> Do you want to try to fix a small issue?

23:18 &lt;kushalk124> Yup
23:18 &lt;kushalk124> would like to do
23:23 &lt;kushalk124> sdumitriu, ?
23:23 &lt;sdumitriu> https://github.com/compbio-UofT/phenotips/issues/389
23:25 &lt;kushalk124> Just one things before I begin
23:26 &lt;sdumitriu> Don't hesitate to ask me questions
23:26 &lt;kushalk124> can you help me understand the file structure
23:26 &lt;sdumitriu> OK
23:26 &lt;sdumitriu> First, did you read http://phenotips.org/Community/SourceRepository ?
23:27 &lt;kushalk124> Yup read that
23:28 &lt;kushalk124> Last night I read about how maven works
23:28 &lt;sdumitriu> K
23:28 &lt;kushalk124> and tried some examples also
23:28 &lt;sdumitriu> So, there are two important places with PhenoTips code
23:28 &lt;sdumitriu> One is everything under components/ (java code)
23:29 &lt;sdumitriu> Two is resources/ui/ (the documents in the wiki)
23:29 &lt;sdumitriu> You shouldn't edit the XML files directly from resources/ui/src/main/resources
23:29 &lt;sdumitriu> But edit in the wiki, then export
23:30 &lt;sdumitriu> The major problem is that we've hidden the UI for developers, so it's a bit harder to get to the edit mode
23:30 &lt;sdumitriu> Here's a trick:
23:30 &lt;sdumitriu> Press Ctrl+G
23:30 &lt;sdumitriu> Type PhenoTips.PatientSheetCode
23:31 &lt;sdumitriu> Then press on the Edit button
23:31 &lt;sdumitriu> (in the browser)
23:31 &lt;sdumitriu> Did you get to the edit mode?
23:32 &lt;kushalk124> I didnt get you ?
23:33 &lt;kushalk124> On what page ?
23:33 &lt;sdumitriu> On the homepage of PhenoTips
23:33 &lt;sdumitriu> Wait
23:33 &lt;sdumitriu> Did you start PhenoTips locally?
23:34 &lt;sdumitriu> After you built it:
23:34 &lt;sdumitriu> cd distribution/standalone
23:34 &lt;sdumitriu> unzip phenotips*
23:36 &lt;kushalk124> the file is in distribution/standalone/target
23:37 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
23:37 &lt;sdumitriu> Right
23:38 &lt;kushalk124> i than ran ./start.sh
23:38 &lt;sdumitriu> Yep
23:38 &lt;sdumitriu> Then open http://localhost:8080 in a browser
23:39 &lt;kushalk124> Started that
23:40 &lt;sdumitriu> OK, now press Ctrl+G
23:40 &lt;sdumitriu> No
23:40 &lt;sdumitriu> Login first
23:40 &lt;sdumitriu> Then press Ctrl+G
23:40 &lt;kushalk124> What is the default login ?
