07:06 &lt;camelia_> hello, I work on db lists and I'd like to kindly ask You in a HQL query after having joined the DBStringListProperty as dbprop  with the BaseObject as obj , how can I access the list items? I feel that there is one more join needed to get to the xwikilistitems....
07:08 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> sdumitriu, marta hi :)
07:11 &lt;camelia_> should I obtain them using elements(dbprop) ?
07:12 &lt;camelia_> sorry , elements(dbprop.list)?
08:27 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> sdumitriu, der ?
08:40 &lt;camelia1789> has joined #ccm
08:44 &lt;sdumitriu> Good morning

08:57 &lt;camelia1789> hello, I work on db lists and I'd like to kindly ask You in a HQL query after having joined the DBStringListProperty as dbprop  with the BaseObject as obj , how can I access the list items? Is it the elements(dbprop.list) that I should use?
09:00 &lt;sdumitriu> In the from part, use:
09:01 &lt;sdumitriu> DBStringListProperty as dbprop join dbprop.list as propvalue
09:01 &lt;sdumitriu> Now propvalue is a value from the list
09:05 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> sdumitriu, Hey
09:05 &lt;sdumitriu> Hey kushalkhandelwal
09:05 &lt;sdumitriu> Still fighting with that bug?
09:06 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Couldn't give that much of time
09:06 &lt;camelia1789> Thank You! I'll try it this way then.
09:06 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> but still trying to figure it out
09:06 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Finally over with project submission
09:10 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> sdumitriu,

10:12 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> has joined #ccm
11:56 &lt;camelia1789> I managed to find smth but I'm not sure it's correct: are the items in omim_id numbers? Like 230350, 300558??
11:58 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
11:59 &lt;camelia1789> Great then! And how can they be decoded into strings?
11:59 &lt;camelia1789> I mean their title/ short description?
12:00 &lt;sdumitriu> Where are you looking? What type of object do you have?
12:00 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> has joined #ccm
12:01 &lt;camelia1789> I made a query that finds all patients' disorders. Just for testing purposes. And now it's all numbers.
12:01 &lt;sdumitriu> Aha
12:02 &lt;camelia1789> Names and numbers, more precisely
12:02 &lt;camelia1789> names of patients and numbers corresponding to their disorders
12:03 &lt;sdumitriu> Well, the OMIM is indexed in Solr as well
12:03 &lt;sdumitriu> So you'd do:
12:04 &lt;sdumitriu> $services.omim.get('230350')
12:04 &lt;sdumitriu> This gives you the Sorl Document for that OMIM term
12:04 &lt;sdumitriu> And then you can do:
12:04 &lt;camelia1789> I did everything in the Java component
12:04 &lt;sdumitriu> $services.omim.get('230350').name to get the name
12:06 &lt;sdumitriu> Ah, Java
12:06 &lt;sdumitriu> OK
12:06 &lt;sdumitriu> Then you get hold of the OMIM component with
12:08 &lt;sdumitriu> @Inject @Named("omim") private ScriptService omimScriptService;
12:08 &lt;sdumitriu> Unfortunately, you'd have to cast it to (OmimScriptService)
12:09 &lt;sdumitriu> I'm working on improving the Solr components
12:10 &lt;camelia1789> Thank You! I'll try Your suggestion.

20:32 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I think I made a cop twice
20:32 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> how do I generate the file without doing  a build ?
20:33 &lt;kushalk124> sdumitriu:
20:47 &lt;sdumitriu> kushalk124: Here's a trick
20:47 &lt;sdumitriu> Click on the Administration link on the upper left menu
20:47 &lt;sdumitriu> Then from the drop down menu on the right, select Wiki administration
20:48 &lt;sdumitriu> Click on Import from the left menu
20:48 &lt;sdumitriu> Upload phenotips/resources/ui/target/phenotips-ui-1.0-SNAPSHOT.xar
20:48 &lt;sdumitriu> When it's done, click on the file name
20:48 &lt;sdumitriu> And then you can select which documents to import</content>
