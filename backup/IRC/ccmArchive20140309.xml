05:31 &lt;raianknight> Hi, could anybody answer to me about the following project idea: "Development of machine learning methods for modeling the evolution of tumors" ? I didn't find any google group connected with your project ideas, only e-mails are presented
05:35 &lt;raianknight> Does this project idea concern to one of your existing projects? In other words, is there some basic application for development such machine learning methods?
05:43 &lt;raianknight> Also, if you think that email is more convenient way to contact each other, you may write to leontev.petr@gmail.com
