12:18 &lt;akats> Is there a way to keep the patient network search component (the one that takes forever to load) loaded in memory?
12:20 &lt;sdumitriu> It is kept in memory after the server restarts
12:20 &lt;sdumitriu> But you can't keep it in memory between restarts
12:22 &lt;akats> At some later point, when I have time, would it be ok if I figured out a way to run it as a separate process? I mean the development of anything that uses this feature would be sped up quite a bit.
12:24 &lt;sdumitriu> I'd rather keep it inside
12:28 &lt;akats> I had not taken a close look at what's happening, but isn't it just doing some calculations that it then stores in cache?
12:55 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes

13:50 &lt;akats> Would this be a proper way of getting a hibernate object by id   session.get(OutgoingSearchRequest.class, requestId); ?
13:52 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
14:15 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: I've been struggling with hibernate for a while, could you take a look at what I'm doing wrong?
