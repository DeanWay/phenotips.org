10:24 &lt;sdumitriu> SayAsh: Hi, you had a question for me?
10:35 &lt;SayAsh> yes, I am getting errors while building the code. I tried to build it folderwise later on and i found the errors are coming from distribution folder of the code
10:35 &lt;sdumitriu> Which version of Maven are you using?
10:36 &lt;SayAsh> 3.2.1
10:36 &lt;SayAsh> its the latest version
10:36 &lt;sdumitriu> Can you switch to 3.0.x?
10:37 &lt;sdumitriu> There's a known bug in one of the maven plugins used for the build
10:37 &lt;SayAsh> ok then i switch to 3.0
10:41 &lt;vishnu93> Hi, I have a question on modifying phenotips
10:41 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi vishnu93
10:41 &lt;vishnu93> how can I see the changes which I made when running phenotips locally?
10:42 &lt;vishnu93> I've tried restarting the server
10:42 &lt;sdumitriu> Where are you making the changes, and how do you obtain the local instance?
10:43 &lt;vishnu93> I'm modifying the components/patients/ folder
10:43 &lt;vishnu93> the UI part
10:44 &lt;vishnu93> by locally I mean offline
10:44 &lt;sdumitriu> OK, I see
10:44 &lt;sdumitriu> Thre are two options
10:44 &lt;sdumitriu> 1: rebuild everything with "mvn clean install", unzip what you get in distribution/standalone/target, and run PhenoTips from there
10:45 &lt;sdumitriu> This takes some time
10:46 &lt;sdumitriu> 2: rebuild only that module ("mvn install" from components/patient-data/ui/) and from the running instance, go to Administration -> Content -> Import, uplod the .xar file you got in the archive, click on it once it uploads, and import either all the files or the files you just modified
10:46 &lt;sdumitriu> This will take less time
10:46 &lt;sdumitriu> There's also a third option:
10:48 &lt;sdumitriu> 3: modify the contents directly in the running instance, through the browse; for example if you want to edit PhenoTips.PatientSheet, go to http://localhost:8080/bin/edit/PhenoTips/PatientSheet
10:48 &lt;sdumitriu> This way you'll see the changes almost instantly
10:48 &lt;vishnu93> I see
10:49 &lt;vishnu93> Thank you, that helped a lot!
10:49 &lt;sdumitriu> Once you're happy with the code, you can export the changed document as XAR (there's a menu entry for that in the UI), unzip it (it's a plain .zip file with a different extension), and copy back the .xml files over the original sources
10:49 &lt;sdumitriu> You'll have to run "mvn xar:format" from the ui module to clean up the .xml though
10:50 &lt;vishnu93> cool I'll try it out :)
11:01 &lt;IonelPopescu> has quit
11:10 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: I've got a working page that outputs user data in json format. However, it's mixed with XWiki html. a GET with &amp;xpage=plain gives out data mixed with html, but adding &amp;outputSyntax=plain breaks the code
11:28 &lt;akats> How important is performance for this functionality?
11:29 &lt;gauravsaini03> has joined #phenotips
11:30 &lt;akats> Actually a better question, how important is proper pagination?
11:31 &lt;sdumitriu> Not at all
11:31 &lt;sdumitriu> We could live with a static list
11:31 &lt;sdumitriu> Listing all the requests
11:32 &lt;akats> Ok. Sweet.
11:53 &lt;SayAsh> @sdumitriu, the code has been built. Can you guide me to next step
11:54 &lt;sdumitriu> https://gsoc.ccm.sickkids.ca/GoogleSummerOfCode/FirstSteps
12:10 &lt;SayAsh>  2nd step says build phenotips and run it. How to run it?
12:10 &lt;akats> Which OS are you using
12:10 &lt;SayAsh> windows 8
12:11 &lt;akats> Do you see a file called start.bat
12:12 &lt;SayAsh> sorry, but where would I find this file?
12:13 &lt;sdumitriu> SayAsh: Go to distribution\standalone\target
12:13 &lt;vishnu93> has quit
12:13 &lt;sdumitriu> There should be a .zip file in there
12:13 &lt;sdumitriu> Unzip it
12:13 &lt;sdumitriu> That's the freshly built PhenoTips instance
12:13 &lt;sdumitriu> In it there's a start.bat file, run it
12:14 &lt;sdumitriu> It will open a console
12:14 &lt;sdumitriu> Once it prints "Server started, you can now open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser" do that
12:35 &lt;SayAsh> success!! localhost opened
12:39 &lt;SayAsh> thanks !!

14:46 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: if I do $response.sendRedirect will Ajax request follow it?
14:46 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
14:47 &lt;akats> Sweet
14:57 &lt;akats> So I wanted to validate the user using the default XWiki method validateUser, however I ran into the problem that getting user's validation key
14:57 &lt;akats> I get back a hash, for ex hash:SHA-512:f1bc6beb91a5daa637fa2f232d6082aa3aa39068da01a9c84f94be64f1513ef8c8ca4c183f62b9f0c9777c815dfe3915984fc6832b249ce73c2cb285365c8868
14:58 &lt;akats> is there a way to convert it?
14:58 &lt;sdumitriu> No
14:58 &lt;sdumitriu> It's a hash
14:58 &lt;sdumitriu> You can't use the validateUser method
