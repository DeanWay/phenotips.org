08:49 &lt;BogdanVancea> so, quite far from Toronto

08:53 &lt;krinye> How is the tech/startup community or culture in Romania?
08:53 &lt;BogdanVancea> hm
08:53 &lt;BogdanVancea> it's definitely growing
08:54 &lt;BogdanVancea> we have a couple of technical groups
08:54 &lt;BogdanVancea> meeting a couple times a month
08:54 &lt;BogdanVancea> and there's a google developer group
08:54 &lt;BogdanVancea> very focused on creating a nice environment for start-ups
08:55 &lt;BogdanVancea> everything evolved a lot in the last 2 years or so
08:55 &lt;BogdanVancea> how about the Toronto area?
08:59 &lt;krinye> Its growing quite rapidly getting alot of students working on projects really exciting stuff
09:00 &lt;krinye> Google seems to have set up a center as well in waterloo near the University of Waterloo, in toronto there are mostly incubators and such looking for the next big thing
09:01 &lt;krinye> Anyways I gotta go in a bit but best of luck in GSOC!
09:01 &lt;BogdanVancea> thanks
09:01 &lt;BogdanVancea> good luck to you too!
09:23 &lt;sdumitriu> Hello
09:24 &lt;sdumitriu> BogdanVancea: Still around?
09:24 &lt;BogdanVancea> hello, sdumitriu
09:24 &lt;BogdanVancea> yes, still around
09:25 &lt;sdumitriu> So, I had a question about your job
09:25 &lt;sdumitriu> You know that GSoC is supposed to be a full time thing, right?
09:26 &lt;BogdanVancea> yes, I do
09:27 &lt;BogdanVancea> and it will, if I get accepted :)
09:28 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes, we'll see about that...
09:28 &lt;sdumitriu> You think you will?
09:28 &lt;BogdanVancea> I'm not sure
09:29 &lt;BogdanVancea> I'm 50-50 %
09:29 &lt;BogdanVancea> I'm very excited to work in an open source environment
09:29 &lt;BogdanVancea> however, there are a lot of things I need to learn
09:30 &lt;BogdanVancea> technical skills and personal skills
09:31 &lt;BogdanVancea> I feel like I've learned a lot from the task I've been given, however, there were a lot of slip-ups
09:31 &lt;BogdanVancea> and I don't think those are in my advantage
09:31 &lt;sdumitriu> It's OK
09:31 &lt;sdumitriu> You're still a student
09:32 &lt;BogdanVancea> that's true
09:33 &lt;BogdanVancea> but one can always improve
09:33 &lt;BogdanVancea> :)
09:35 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes, and that's also one of the goals of GSoC
09:35 &lt;sdumitriu> Improving your coding skills and meta-skills
09:37 &lt;BogdanVancea> yes, that's why I decided to apply
09:39 &lt;BogdanVancea> is the fact that I am currently employed a disadvantage for me?
09:40 &lt;sdumitriu> A bit, yes
09:41 &lt;BogdanVancea> I see
09:42 &lt;BogdanVancea> I thought it might be like that
09:42 &lt;BogdanVancea> :)
09:50 &lt;BogdanVancea> I did, however, want to give it a try :)
09:50 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes, we'll see
09:51 &lt;sdumitriu> A little more than 29 hours left until the announcements
09:52 &lt;sdumitriu> Ah, no
09:52 &lt;sdumitriu> Forgot it's Saturday
09:52 &lt;sdumitriu> So, more than two days...
09:52 &lt;BogdanVancea> I just checked a couple of mins ago
09:52 &lt;sdumitriu> Ah, the suspense...
09:52 &lt;BogdanVancea> yes, 2 days
09:52 &lt;BogdanVancea> ;))
09:53 &lt;BogdanVancea> tbh, it is
09:54 &lt;BogdanVancea> 'm not sure how it works tho
09:54 &lt;BogdanVancea> do the organizations decided and gsoc staff just approves?
09:54 &lt;BogdanVancea> decide*
09:55 &lt;sdumitriu> No, organizations do everything
09:55 &lt;BogdanVancea> ah, I see
09:55 &lt;sdumitriu> Except decide how many slots they get
09:55 &lt;sdumitriu> Google distributes the slots
09:55 &lt;BogdanVancea> makes more sense that way
09:55 &lt;sdumitriu> So yeah, I already know who's going to be accepted
09:55 &lt;sdumitriu> Just toying with you
09:56 &lt;BogdanVancea> ;))
09:56 &lt;BogdanVancea> I see
09:56 &lt;BogdanVancea> can you tell me how many students will be accepted?
09:56 &lt;BogdanVancea> for ccm
09:57 &lt;sdumitriu> 5
09:57 &lt;BogdanVancea> quite a few
09:57 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes, a handful
09:58 &lt;BogdanVancea> =))
09:58 &lt;BogdanVancea> nice pun
09:59 &lt;BogdanVancea> and how about xwiki?
09:59 &lt;sdumitriu> Just 1
09:59 &lt;BogdanVancea> you said you're a mentor there aswell
09:59 &lt;BogdanVancea> oh
09:59 &lt;sdumitriu&gt; The quality of the proposals was terrible
09:59 &lt;sdumitriu> If it were after me, I wouldn't have accepted that one either
10:00 &lt;BogdanVancea> ah
10:00 &lt;ravigarg27> has joined #ccm
10:00 &lt;sdumitriu> Hey Ravi
10:00 &lt;BogdanVancea> hello :)
10:01 &lt;sdumitriu> Anyway, that was for the better, since I moved the extra slots to CCM
10:01 &lt;sdumitriu> Being admin for two orgs has its advantages
10:01 &lt;sdumitriu> (CCM had 2 initially)
10:02 &lt;BogdanVancea> ah, I see
10:02 &lt;ravigarg27> hii sdumitriu1
10:02 &lt;BogdanVancea> and xwiki 4
10:02 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
10:02 &lt;sdumitriu> First timers always get very few slots
10:03 &lt;sdumitriu> XWiki asked between 2 and 4, and got 4
10:03 &lt;sdumitriu> CCM asked between 5 and 9, and got 2
10:03 &lt;sdumitriu> How is that fair?
10:03 &lt;BogdanVancea> wow
10:03 &lt;BogdanVancea> I think it solely because it was the first year
10:03 &lt;BogdanVancea> for ccm
10:04 &lt;BogdanVancea> it's*
10:04 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
10:04 &lt;sdumitriu> Although we did say several times that we're actually veterans forming a new organization
10:04 &lt;sdumitriu> But when you have to review 500 organizations, you can't remember the details for everyone
10:05 &lt;BogdanVancea> so you, marta and mark were all previous mentors?
10:05 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
10:05 &lt;BogdanVancea> nice
10:06 &lt;BogdanVancea> for how many years?
10:06 &lt;sdumitriu> Me and Marta started as students back in 2005
10:06 &lt;sdumitriu> I've been mentor since 2007
10:06 &lt;BogdanVancea> wow, you're really a veteran
10:07 &lt;ravigarg27> 6 years nice :)
10:07 &lt;sdumitriu> Marc I think started three years ago, mentoring for NRNB
10:08 &lt;sdumitriu> When evaluating students, I have to keep reminding myself what a lousy application I wrote in my first year
10:08 &lt;sdumitriu> But things were different, being the first edition there was a complete lack of organization
10:08 &lt;sdumitriu> There were no guides
10:09 &lt;sdumitriu> No application templates to let students know what they should fill in
10:09 &lt;sdumitriu> I would simply discard my application as span now
10:09 &lt;sdumitriu> spam
10:09 &lt;BogdanVancea> I see :))
10:10 &lt;BogdanVancea> its only normal that standards rise
10:10 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
10:10 &lt;BogdanVancea> what did you work on in your first year?
10:11 &lt;sdumitriu> http://www.drdobbs.com/googles-summer-of-code-part-ii/184406383#0601ds4
10:12 &lt;BogdanVancea> nice
10:12 &lt;BogdanVancea> so you've been involved with xwiki
10:12 &lt;BogdanVancea> from the start
10:16 &lt;sdumitriu> Ah, I have to set up an anti-spam solution for phenotips.org....
10:17 &lt;BogdanVancea> what type of spam?
10:19 &lt;sdumitriu> Well, spam bots now start by writing "flattering" comments, and then a few days later start posting links
10:19 &lt;sdumitriu> I delete that the next day, but it's still bad
10:20 &lt;sdumitriu> I left an open demo on phenotips.org so that people interested in the project can quickly test it without having to register
10:20 &lt;sdumitriu> But now spambots found the site and abuse it
10:22 &lt;BogdanVancea> ugh, nasty problem
10:46 &lt;sdumitriu> ravigarg27: Do you want to learn some CSS and JS the hard way?
10:46 &lt;ravigarg27> yeah sure
10:47 &lt;sdumitriu> https://github.com/sdumitriu/frontend-tests/

14:08 &lt;sdumitriu> K
14:10 &lt;ravigarg27> can you please explain where I am doing wrong in that code
14:10 &lt;ravigarg27> I dont seem to get it
14:12 &lt;ravigarg27> its like more the maxScore more similar are the strings right?
14:22 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
14:24 &lt;ravigarg27> umm then what am I missing?
14:26 &lt;sdumitriu> The naming of things
14:26 &lt;sdumitriu> The name of a variable or a method is very important
14:32 &lt;ravigarg27> ohh so the logic is correct right?
14:44 &lt;ravigarg27> I have changed the variables name you suggested
14:47 &lt;ravigarg27> and also the method
