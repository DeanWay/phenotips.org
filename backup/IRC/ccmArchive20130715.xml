10:15 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hi ravigarg27_
10:34 &lt;ravigarg27> has joined #ccm
10:34 &lt;ravigarg27> Hey sdumitriu1, sorry had gone for dinner
10:35 &lt;ravigarg27> The external resources now is running fine but it doesnt get initialised when I include dictionary lookup annotator
10:35 &lt;ravigarg27> doesnt show any error too
10:36 &lt;ravigarg27> also have given apt memory so that shudnt also be an issue
10:37 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hi Ravi
10:37 &lt;sdumitriu1> Well, I don't know what to say, there is no timeout set on the thread
10:38 &lt;sdumitriu1> Did you try to debug it?
10:38 &lt;sdumitriu1> See where it fails?
10:38 &lt;sdumitriu1> I can't help you very much without seeing the code
10:38 &lt;ravigarg27> yeah I tried that
10:38 &lt;ravigarg27> If I dont include the dictionary one it work good
10:39 &lt;ravigarg27> but after I include it it doesnt show up anything
10:39 &lt;sdumitriu1> Note that you don't need to wait for the code to be perfect (or event functional) before you commit it
10:39 &lt;sdumitriu1> One common way to commit work in progress is to create a feature branch and perform regular commits there
10:39 &lt;sdumitriu1> This way, the code is available for the team to provide feedback, the  master branch is not affected by half-done features, and the feature  branch can be easily merged into the master one the implementation is  stable
10:39 &lt;ravigarg27> ok I will to that today itself
10:39 &lt;sdumitriu1> Committing is not releasing
10:39 &lt;sdumitriu1> You should commit very often
10:40 &lt;sdumitriu1> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often
10:40 &lt;ravigarg27> okay sure I will start from today itself
10:40 &lt;sdumitriu1> Commit early, commit often
10:40 &lt;sdumitriu1> I have to go for a short while, will be back soon
10:40 &lt;ravigarg27> okay

14:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> Push where?
14:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> In the repo
14:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hm...
14:13 &lt;ravigarg27_> yeah
14:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> Not sure
14:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> They should be external resources
14:13 &lt;ravigarg27_> yup
14:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> In a different repo
14:17 &lt;ravigarg27_> I need to make a branch in my forked repo right ?
14:18 &lt;sdumitriu1> What for?
14:19 &lt;ravigarg27_> you said a feature branch so I though of making a branch in my forked repo and then doing pull request
14:19 &lt;sdumitriu1> Right
14:19 &lt;ravigarg27_> sorry very new to github
14:19 &lt;ravigarg27_> ohh okay
14:20 &lt;sdumitriu1> Sorry, we were talking about the external resources right before, wasn't sure what was the branch for
14:22 &lt;ravigarg27_> no its ok for now I will commit to this repo only I have reduced it to like 14-15 mb
14:23 &lt;ravigarg27_> then later on whereever you say
14:23 &lt;sdumitriu1> OK, that sounds reasonable
