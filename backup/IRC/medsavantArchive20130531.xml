16:15 &lt;sdumitriu> Hey BogdanVancea
16:15 &lt;BogdanVancea> hello, sdumitriu
16:15 &lt;BogdanVancea> :)
16:15 &lt;BogdanVancea> how are you?
16:15 &lt;sdumitriu> Good
16:15 &lt;sdumitriu> Productive
16:16 &lt;sdumitriu> The MedSavant build should work now in any IDE
16:16 &lt;sdumitriu> At least it works for me in Eclipse
16:16 &lt;sdumitriu> And it works from the command line
16:17 &lt;BogdanVancea> awesome
16:17 &lt;sdumitriu> You should test it
16:17 &lt;BogdanVancea> I just pulled everything from git
16:18 &lt;BogdanVancea> awesome
16:18 &lt;BogdanVancea> I see you've moved all the icons
16:18 &lt;BogdanVancea> in the resource folder
16:18 &lt;sdumitriu> Yep
16:18 &lt;BogdanVancea> after you left yesterday
16:18 &lt;BogdanVancea> I bounced into the problem
16:18 &lt;BogdanVancea> and was to lazy to move everything
16:18 &lt;BogdanVancea> just renamed with iconroot variable
16:19 &lt;BogdanVancea> the project is so nice and organized now
16:19 &lt;BogdanVancea> :D
16:19 &lt;sdumitriu> Eh, there's still work to do
16:20 &lt;BogdanVancea> ;))
16:20 &lt;BogdanVancea> there's always some work to be done
16:20 &lt;BogdanVancea> how did you run it from the command line?
16:21 &lt;sdumitriu> mvn clean install &amp;&amp; cd MedSavantClient/target/ &amp;&amp; java -jar medsavant-client-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
16:23 &lt;BogdanVancea> ah, cool
16:23 &lt;BogdanVancea> I think I saw a .sh script somewhere
16:23 &lt;BogdanVancea> it didn't work for me when I tried it, and I don't seem to find it now
16:26 &lt;sdumitriu> Yeah, it was useless
16:26 &lt;sdumitriu> I removed it
16:26 &lt;BogdanVancea> I see
16:27 &lt;BogdanVancea> btw, I just remembered that when I read the idea for the project
16:27 &lt;BogdanVancea> you mentioned test driven development
16:27 &lt;BogdanVancea> I haven't worked that way before
16:27 &lt;BogdanVancea> how should that work? :)
16:28 &lt;sdumitriu> :)
16:28 &lt;sdumitriu> The idea is that before writing code, you have to define the specifications: what is the code supposed to do?
16:28 &lt;sdumitriu> So you do that by writing actual tests
16:29 &lt;sdumitriu> That call methods from your new class and verify the output
16:29 &lt;sdumitriu> MedSavant has 0 tests :(
16:29 &lt;BogdanVancea> ah
16:29 &lt;BogdanVancea> ;))
16:29 &lt;BogdanVancea> hmm
16:29 &lt;BogdanVancea> are JUnit tests ok?
16:30 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
16:30 &lt;sdumitriu> https://github.com/compbio-UofT/phenotips/blob/master/components/patient-measurements/api/src/test/java/edu/toronto/cs/phenotips/measurements/MeasurementsScriptServiceTest.java
16:30 &lt;BogdanVancea> ah
16:30 &lt;BogdanVancea> mockito
16:30 &lt;BogdanVancea> awesome
16:30 &lt;BogdanVancea> I can finally use it
16:30 &lt;sdumitriu> And I really mean that you write the test before the code
16:30 &lt;BogdanVancea> with an actual reason
16:30 &lt;sdumitriu> Initially tests fail
16:31 &lt;sdumitriu> After you write the test case, you need to make it compile by writing the class/methods under test
16:31 &lt;sdumitriu> Then you have to write the method logic that makes the test pass
16:32 &lt;BogdanVancea> I see
16:32 &lt;BogdanVancea> so I don't need to mock the components I want to test?
16:33 &lt;sdumitriu> Well, MedSavant doesn't have components either :(
16:33 &lt;sdumitriu> But you can mock other class fields
16:33 &lt;BogdanVancea> true
16:34 &lt;BogdanVancea> I'm actually excited
16:34 &lt;BogdanVancea> I didn't get the chance to do something like this before
16:34 &lt;BogdanVancea> also, am I the only student admitted for developing on Medsavant?
16:35 &lt;sdumitriu> No
16:35 &lt;sdumitriu> There's another one, but so far he didn't reply
16:35 &lt;sdumitriu> Probably offline
16:36 &lt;sdumitriu> Travelling back to his country
16:36 &lt;BogdanVancea> ah
16:36 &lt;BogdanVancea> I see
16:36 &lt;sdumitriu> I sent you something
16:36 &lt;BogdanVancea> thanks, reading it now :)
16:38 &lt;BogdanVancea> nice, this will be great for a read before bed
16:39 &lt;sdumitriu> It's short, so it shouldn't take long to read
16:39 &lt;sdumitriu> Anyway, the idea was to start with creating the Solr index, then start to code it
16:40 &lt;BogdanVancea> makes sense
16:40 &lt;BogdanVancea> should I index everything in solr?
16:40 &lt;BogdanVancea> or would it be better to go gradually
16:41 &lt;sdumitriu> Better gradually
16:41 &lt;BogdanVancea> nice
16:42 &lt;BogdanVancea> ICE is actually a mysql database, right?
16:42 &lt;BogdanVancea> "modified" mysql
16:42 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
16:43 &lt;sdumitriu> http://mail.medsavant.com/mailman/listinfo/notification -> You can subscribe to receive commit notifications, if you want
16:44 &lt;BogdanVancea> thanks
17:13 &lt;sdumitriu> So, how was the first week?
17:15 &lt;BogdanVancea> pretty good
17:15 &lt;BogdanVancea> I actually excepted to do more
17:15 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes, you're gonna have to get used to it
17:15 &lt;sdumitriu> Time flies
17:16 &lt;BogdanVancea> true
17:17 &lt;BogdanVancea> but I'm confident I'll improve my pace
17:17 &lt;BogdanVancea> I never do manage to get a lot of things done in the first week
17:18 &lt;BogdanVancea> doesn't really matter what I'm trying to do
