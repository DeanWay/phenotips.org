17:28 &lt;reid_a> Hey! Is there anyone around if I had a couple questions about Summer of Code stuff?
17:34 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi reid_a
17:34 &lt;sdumitriu> Sure
17:36 &lt;reid_a> Hey, I was looking around your suggested ideas and the two related to modeling tumors really interested me.
17:37 &lt;reid_a> I didn't see any links to the source code and was wondering if it was freely available. What I'm really asking is what would be the best way to start getting involved?
17:41 &lt;Ravneet> has joined #ccm
17:46 &lt;sdumitriu> I'm not sure about those ideas, since they're somebody else's projects
17:47 &lt;sdumitriu> Best thing to do is to send an email to Quaid
17:48 &lt;reid_a> Alright, I'll do that. Thanks for your time
17:50 &lt;sdumitriu> You're welcome
