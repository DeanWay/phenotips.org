13:48 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: What is the link for the phenomecentral playground?
13:48 &lt;sdumitriu> copy.
13:52 &lt;akats> There's a broken image when clicking on "What's this" by the Monarch score in the phenotypes selection. https://playground.phenotips.org/bin/edit/data/P0000060#HClinicalsymptomsandphysicalfindings

14:27 &lt;akats> Did xwiki switch to exporting all documents (in the administration) in xar format (rather than zip) or is that something wrong with my install?
14:28 &lt;sdumitriu> It's always been xar
14:28 &lt;sdumitriu> Which is a zip
14:29 &lt;akats> That's true. Nevermind. Just stopped working with my archive manager.
14:48 &lt;akats> I don't think there are any more issue for me
14:51 &lt;sdumitriu> Let me find something
14:52 &lt;akats> Thanks.
14:53 &lt;akats> By the way, does Xwiki have something like cron?
14:54 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
14:55 &lt;sdumitriu> http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Scheduler+Application
14:55 &lt;sdumitriu> It is available in PhenoTips already, although the UI for it is missing
14:57 &lt;akats> Thanks. I don't need UI. This is the only way I see of responding to requests asynchronously.
14:59 &lt;sdumitriu> Not sure...
14:59 &lt;sdumitriu> You should do it differently
15:00 &lt;sdumitriu> When a request comes:
15:00 &lt;sdumitriu> 1. Is the response expected synchronously? If yes, then search, get results, format the response, send it as a reply to the request
15:03 &lt;akats> Well for case number 2, when the other server wants an asychronous response, I should first return a 200 response, and then send the results to the asychronous endpoint
15:03 &lt;sdumitriu> 2: Is the response async? Yes, add a task in a queue, then return
15:04 &lt;sdumitriu> 3: Is the response email? Same as 2
15:04 &lt;sdumitriu> There's a queue processor which gets the tasks from queue, runs them, and based on the response type, either sends an email or makes a HTTPS request
15:05 &lt;akats> So you're saying XWiki has a queuing processor?
15:06 &lt;sdumitriu> No, I'm saying Java has one
15:06 &lt;sdumitriu> Searching for it...
15:08 &lt;akats> Oh, good old Java has everything.
15:08 &lt;sdumitriu> http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html
15:11 &lt;akats> So to my understanding it just sits in a separate thread, and get's checked when nothing else is happening?
15:14 &lt;sdumitriu> It does sit in a separate thread, but it always runs
15:17 &lt;akats> I see, thanks
