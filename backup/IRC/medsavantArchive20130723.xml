05:35 &lt;mcupak> hey sdumitriu
06:06 &lt;mcupak> sdumitriu: when you're here, could you please quickly check what happened on medsavant master?
06:07 &lt;mcupak> sdumitriu: I unintentionally ran git push on all my branches, which generated the commits listed above on master - not sure what actually happened, it's probably just a merge of other people's changes, but it seems kind of weird so I just want to be sure I didn't damage anything
06:50 &lt;sdumitriu> Hey mcupak
06:50 &lt;sdumitriu> Checking
07:00 &lt;sdumitriu> mcupak: I reverted your push
07:01 &lt;sdumitriu> There was only one actual commit, and a bunch of merges after that, some of which introduced conflicts
07:01 &lt;sdumitriu> You should discard your master branch and switch to the official master
07:46 &lt;mcupak> thanks, and sorry about that
07:46 &lt;mcupak> I was actually only trying to push to my fork on a different branch, but something went wrong
07:47 &lt;mcupak> whenever I feel I have git at least slightly figured out, it surprises me like this :-/

08:52 &lt;bvancea> hey sdumitriu
08:52 &lt;sdumitriu> Hey bvancea
08:53 &lt;bvancea> I'm trying to think of a way to handle the insertion of entities
08:53 &lt;bvancea> in the abstraction layer
08:53 &lt;bvancea> since JPQL does not provide support for insert statements
08:53 &lt;bvancea> do you have any ideas?
08:54 &lt;sdumitriu> Two things
08:55 &lt;sdumitriu> One, don't use JPQL but something from JPA
08:55 &lt;sdumitriu> Two, add our own INSERT statement
08:55 &lt;sdumitriu> But I don't like 2 that much
08:55 &lt;sdumitriu> If we do work with entities, we should just have a way to store entities
08:55 &lt;sdumitriu> INSERT statements are too low level
08:56 &lt;bvancea> yeah
08:56 &lt;sdumitriu> INSERT is targeting rows and columns
08:56 &lt;sdumitriu> And by moving to JPQL we're trying to switch to entities
08:57 &lt;bvancea> true
08:57 &lt;bvancea> JPA uses the EntityManager for persistence
08:58 &lt;bvancea> unlike HQL, which adds an insert statement
08:59 &lt;sdumitriu> I like the persist(Object) API
08:59 &lt;bvancea> me too, its simpler
08:59 &lt;sdumitriu> I wonder how well does it behave with a million objects
08:59 &lt;sdumitriu> We'd probably have to add an autocommit or something
09:00 &lt;sdumitriu> So that we don't fill up the memory
09:00 &lt;sdumitriu> (when working with ICE)
09:00 &lt;sdumitriu> Solr has autocommit already
09:00 &lt;sdumitriu> I mean, in Solr we can't have transactions
09:00 &lt;sdumitriu> Hm, or no
09:01 &lt;sdumitriu> Discard that
09:01 &lt;sdumitriu> Transactions are handled by the database, we just send data to the database, and the database isn't stupid enough to hold everything in memory
09:01 &lt;sdumitriu> Gotta go to the lab, ttyl

14:34 &lt;sdumitriu1> New in Solr 4.4: schemaless mode
14:44 &lt;marta> bea tu
14:45 &lt;marta> sorry, wrong chat :D
14:52 &lt;bvancea> sdumitriu: nice
14:53 &lt;bvancea> they've been saying they want to include that in a future release
14:54 &lt;bvancea> wonder if its stable
14:55 &lt;bvancea> they seem to have removed the solr 3.6 link from the website, only the 4.4 link there now
