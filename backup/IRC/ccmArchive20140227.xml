11:01 &lt;ati94> Yeah, but i am trying to do my best
11:03 &lt;ati94> I dont know if you can help me, but i would like to get  more information about one of your  projects
11:05 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes, I can
11:05 &lt;sdumitriu> Which project
11:06 &lt;ati94> Could you wait a sec,  i have to look for the full title of the project
11:08 &lt;ati94> Development  of machine learning methods for modelling the evolution of tumor
11:09 &lt;sdumitriu> OK, that project is coordinated by someone else
11:11 &lt;sdumitriu> Quaid isn't here usually, so you have to contact him by email and ask for further instructions
11:14 &lt;ati94> Okay thank you then. Actually i ve already sent a message to him. (Actually it was just yesterday) but i hoped i could find him here.
11:15 &lt;sdumitriu> He's quite busy, will answer soon
11:16 &lt;ati94> I can understand totally
11:20 &lt;ati94> Bytheway, is there any chance to get this project? I am gonna finish my first year at the university
11:20 &lt;sdumitriu> I don't know, but from what I've seen it's quite a popular project
11:21 &lt;sdumitriu> I think Quaid will be looking for someone more experienced in machine learning, preferably a masters student
11:24 &lt;ati94> Then probably i should look for an other projects then.
11:24 &lt;sdumitriu> It's always good to have a backup plan
11:25 &lt;ati94> But thanks for your help
