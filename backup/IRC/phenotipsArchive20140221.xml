12:24 &lt;akats2> do you need spelling corrector functionality too?
12:26 &lt;akats2> and also do you want to limit the number of results given out to 10?
12:30 &lt;sdumitriu> Spelling would be great
12:30 &lt;sdumitriu> I'm not sure it's a must, but it would be nice to have it
12:31 &lt;sdumitriu> The way we do for HPO is to use different boosts for different fields
12:31 &lt;sdumitriu> 10 results should be enough, the user should type more to get different results
12:32 &lt;akats2> Am I supposed to see it in the xml response or is it only gotten through response.getSpellCheckResponse() ?
12:32 &lt;sdumitriu> It should be in the XML if you ask for it
12:32 &lt;sdumitriu> You need two more parameters
12:33 &lt;sdumitriu> Check what the abstract solr ontology does when building the query
12:34 &lt;akats2> gotcha
13:05 &lt;akats2> I just found a bug in gitHub
13:05 &lt;akats2> I'll show you later
14:27 &lt;akats> has joined #phenotips
14:42 &lt;akats> Might have found a very low priority bug in Phenotips
14:45 &lt;sdumitriu> Which one?
14:47 &lt;akats> Make new patient record, create new measurement, enter nothing, cancel edit
14:48 &lt;akats> Also, """ Currently terms such as macrocephaly and growth terms are auto-populated  from the prenatal measurements and the clinical synopsis measurements  fields. """. I can't get it to do this.
14:58 &lt;akats> Sergiu, I know exactly what we'll have them do! We'll have them write tests! Lots and lots of tests.
14:59 &lt;sdumitriu> Do you think that's gonna be pleasant for them?
15:01 &lt;akats> No. Not at all. Is it supposed to be?
15:01 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes, a bit
15:01 &lt;akats> Oh, I see
15:01 &lt;sdumitriu> We're also competing with other famous organizations to get the best students
15:02 &lt;akats> What kind of students are they. Highschool or Undergrad?
15:02 &lt;sdumitriu> Undergrad -> PostDocs
15:02 &lt;sdumitriu> Mostly undergrads and masters
15:03 &lt;akats> Wow.
15:03 &lt;akats> Can we have them implement features?
15:03 &lt;akats> new features that is
15:03 &lt;sdumitriu> After they get accepted, yes
15:03 &lt;sdumitriu> That's the goal
15:03 &lt;sdumitriu> Small tasks are just in the beginning, to prove that they're worthy
15:04 &lt;sdumitriu> The acceptance ratio is less than 20%
15:05 &lt;akats> How can that be? They are professional programmers
15:14 &lt;akats> This is odd. I built master. But the only thing that gets selected automatically is "Stature for age". "Weight" and "Head circumference" are both not being selected.
15:25 &lt;akats> So this is a solid bug that I found. There are several ways to trigger it.
17:59 &lt;akats> So it appears that right now the whole automatic selection process is meant to be used only with "extreme-". All of the hooks that I've seen are only "extreme-" and more importantly the unselection process works only with "extreme-"
18:00 &lt;akats> So really the easy fix would be a one way street to "above-norm" and "below-norm". But you said that some definitions are based on percentiles and some on S.D.
18:03 &lt;sdumitriu> Hm, indeed, they only work with extreme-*
18:03 &lt;sdumitriu> I was pretty sure I saw one with below-normal a few days ago when looking at that code
18:04 &lt;sdumitriu> But it should be easy to make the code work with both values
18:05 &lt;akats> Um... is there a reason why the unselect is written as ['extreme-below-normal', 'extreme-above-normal'].without(values[p]['valCategory'] || '').each(function(val)
18:06 &lt;sdumitriu> There's a reason for everything
18:06 &lt;sdumitriu> Sometimes, Marta works in misterious ways...
18:08 &lt;akats> Is it ok if I rewrite it?
18:08 &lt;sdumitriu> Sure
18:08 &lt;akats> ok
