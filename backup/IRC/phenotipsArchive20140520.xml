09:36 &lt;mcupak> has quit
10:35 &lt;akats> has joined #phenotips
11:34 &lt;akats> Are there calculations made for left/right hand length? I see only - instead of a usual percentile number calculation
11:35 &lt;sdumitriu> There should be
12:18 &lt;akats> Its a bug in a newer build
12:19 &lt;akats> It's fairly recent
12:19 &lt;akats> Maybe in the last 2 weeks
12:19 &lt;sdumitriu> Hm...
12:19 &lt;sdumitriu> Nothing changed there
12:20 &lt;sdumitriu> Indeed, it doesn't work on Playground either
12:21 &lt;sdumitriu> Can you debug it?
12:22 &lt;akats> Yes
12:22 &lt;akats> It's somewhere in the /bin/get/PhenoTips/PatientToolsService
12:22 &lt;akats> shall I make a separate issue?
12:22 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
12:22 &lt;akats> ok
12:27 &lt;sdumitriu> akats: Did you look into https://github.com/phenotips/phenotips/issues/756 at some point?
12:28 &lt;akats> Nope.
12:29 &lt;akats> First time I see the github page
12:29 &lt;sdumitriu> OK
12:29 &lt;akats> Do you want to assign it to me?
12:30 &lt;sdumitriu> Nope
12:52 &lt;akats> found the issue.
12:52 &lt;akats> the data array for hands is sparce
12:52 &lt;akats> so it goes 24, 48, etc
12:52 &lt;akats> whereas weight for example is continious
12:53 &lt;akats> the current code can't work with sparce arrays
12:53 &lt;sdumitriu> It used to work with gaps...
12:54 &lt;akats> https://github.com/phenotips/phenotips/blob/master/components/patient-measurements/api/src/main/java/org/phenotips/measurements/internal/AbstractMeasurementHandler.java#L241
12:54 &lt;akats> Thats the problem
12:55 &lt;akats> but it is not the code that changed
12:56 &lt;sdumitriu> Oh, I see, the issue is that there's no measurement for 0 months
12:56 &lt;sdumitriu> It only works from 2 years upwards
16:04 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: I'm looking into this issue right now https://github.com/phenotips/phenotips/issues/93. I'm also remember you talking about having to make the csv export nicer with several lines per patient.
16:05 &lt;akats> Thinking of how these problems can be implemented, I started wondering if it would be better to use a spreadsheet generation library
16:10 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes, we could
16:10 &lt;sdumitriu1> It's quite simple to use
16:11 &lt;sdumitriu1> I think we already have the libraries for that in the application
16:11 &lt;sdumitriu1> You can look into http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/LiveTableExcelExport+Macro
16:12 &lt;sdumitriu1> Not to use it directly, but to see how to create an excel file
16:12 &lt;sdumitriu1> http://poi.apache.org/
16:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> akats: It looks like I'm not coming back today after all
16:14 &lt;akats> I see. Are you ok to chat though or are you busy?
16:35 &lt;sdumitriu1> A bit later
16:38 &lt;akats> Ok. Well I'll just outline what I'm thinking
16:40 &lt;akats> - Should we write to both Microsoft and Open/Libre office formats?
16:43 &lt;akats> Should we use newer or older formats?
16:43 &lt;mcupak> has quit
16:55 &lt;akats> Is it really worth it to switch? The real power of not using csv comes from the ability to have cells with column span and text formatting
16:55 &lt;akats> Column span would be really nice to subdivide phenotype column into more columns
16:56 &lt;akats> And formatting text would be nice for making the document much more readable on the whole
16:57 &lt;akats> I'm wondering just how often do doctors export data? Or if not often, how important is it to have good export?
17:30 &lt;akats> The conclusion that I have arrived at: If export is an important feature, we should definitely make the switch. The ease of reading a spreadsheet is probably times better when there is formatting present such as font weight, style, color, size, borders, column widths and row eights.
17:30 &lt;akats> It would make sense to ship out only microsoft format as the quality of conversion seems ok now
17:34 &lt;sdumitriu1> I think new format
17:35 &lt;sdumitriu1> And both ODS and XLSX
17:36 &lt;akats> Ok. Since this is the only issue I have that I can work on I just want to know if you want me to implement the library or to hack what we have now
17:36 &lt;akats> So that when I come in tomorrow I have something to work on
17:36 &lt;sdumitriu1> Many european countries want a "standard" format for government documents
17:36 &lt;sdumitriu1> And OD* is that format
17:36 &lt;sdumitriu1> Implement what library?
17:37 &lt;akats> well we'll probably have to either implement 2 (poi and http://incubator.apache.org/odftoolkit/odfdom/index.html)
17:37 &lt;akats> or implement poi and a converter
17:37 &lt;sdumitriu1> You don't implement POI, you use it
17:38 &lt;akats> Sorry, I meant implement using
17:38 &lt;sdumitriu1> Implementing new format would be better
17:40 &lt;akats> Ok. I'll start on it tomorrow. I'll try to make flexible. To reasonable limits of course.
