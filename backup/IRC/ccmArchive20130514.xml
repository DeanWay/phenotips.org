16:09 &lt;sdumitriu1> Not yet
16:09 &lt;Kushalk124> BogdanVancea, Thanks Downloaded it :)
16:09 &lt;sdumitriu1> I was waiting for some data from @marta
16:09 &lt;BogdanVancea> Kushalk124, you're welcome
16:09 &lt;Kushalk124> sdumitriu1, Working on the new issue :)
16:10 &lt;BogdanVancea> Okay, l let me know when to start then :)
16:10 &lt;BogdanVancea> Let*
16:10 &lt;Kushalk124> BogdanVancea, I was thinking how data from PhenoTips can be used
16:10 &lt;Kushalk124> How we can analyze the data
16:11 &lt;Kushalk124> It might interest you as well
16:12 &lt;BogdanVancea> Hmm, sounds interesting
16:12 &lt;BogdanVancea> What are you thinking?
16:12 &lt;Kushalk124> The main purpose of phenotips  is to collect data
16:13 &lt;Kushalk124> to able to predict rare genetic disorders
16:13 &lt;Kushalk124> So I was thinking how we can contribute to it
16:13 &lt;Kushalk124> sdumitriu1, Would be able to help us on this
16:15 &lt;BogdanVancea> I'm not really all that familiar with phenotype, I've looked into medsavant more
16:15 &lt;BogdanVancea> How does phenotips predict disorders?
16:16 &lt;Kushalk124> From what I was able to understand was that
16:16 &lt;Kushalk124> The doctor fills in the symptoms
16:16 &lt;Kushalk124> HPO terms
16:16 &lt;Kushalk124> which are correlated  to OMIM disorders
16:16 &lt;Kushalk124> So the best match is predicted
16:16 &lt;Kushalk124> Thats how it help in diagnosis
16:16 &lt;Kushalk124> Now on the research part
16:17 &lt;Kushalk124> Collecting data from numerous patients
16:17 &lt;Kushalk124> would help to predict rare genetic disorders
16:17 &lt;Kushalk124> for which you need a good amount of data
16:17 &lt;Kushalk124> hence phenotips
16:17 &lt;Kushalk124> as anonymous data can be shared
16:17 &lt;Kushalk124> Read last nights IRC log
16:18 &lt;Kushalk124> sdumitriu1, explained me more on it
16:18 &lt;BogdanVancea> Ah, ok :)
16:20 &lt;BogdanVancea> How can I access the log archive?
16:20 &lt;Kushalk124> phenotips.org/IRC/
16:20 &lt;sdumitriu1> When you log in it should be displayed in the welcome message
16:21 &lt;Kushalk124> ?
16:21 &lt;BogdanVancea>  it gave me, the requested document could bit be found
16:21 &lt;Kushalk124> This is the link
16:21 &lt;Kushalk124> work for me
16:21 &lt;BogdanVancea> Works now
16:21 &lt;sdumitriu1> http://phenotips.org/IRC/phenotipsArchive20130513
16:22 &lt;sdumitriu1> Starting at 21:40
16:23 &lt;Kushalk124> sdumitriu1, What is defined it MeasurementsClass ?
16:23 &lt;Kushalk124> I cant read it withing the application
16:23 &lt;sdumitriu1> WDYM?
16:24 &lt;BogdanVancea> Thanks :)
16:24 &lt;Kushalk124> Nothing found it
16:24 &lt;Kushalk124> in components
16:24 &lt;Kushalk124> I was looking where the code has to be put
16:24 &lt;Kushalk124> in Patientsheetcode
16:24 &lt;Kushalk124> or patient-measurements
16:28 &lt;sdumitriu1> PatientSheetCode
16:30 &lt;BogdanVancea> Ah, I understand
16:32 &lt;sdumitriu1> BogdanVancea: How well do you know Maven?
16:33 &lt;BogdanVancea> Um, a 6-7 on a scale Bertrand 1 and 10
16:33 &lt;BogdanVancea> Between
16:34 &lt;BogdanVancea> Phone has the most interesting corrections
16:34 &lt;BogdanVancea> I have configured some plugins, worked with aggregated poms, the basic  stuff I guess
16:35 &lt;sdumitriu1> OK
16:36 &lt;Kushalk124> I would take a leave , too late
16:36 &lt;Kushalk124> Sleep time
16:36 &lt;Kushalk124> Good night sdumitriu , BogdanVancea

17:10 &lt;BogdanVancea> I just received the email from Marta
17:10 &lt;BogdanVancea> :)
17:11 &lt;BogdanVancea> I'll start on
17:11 &lt;BogdanVancea> It
17:22 &lt;sdumitriu1> Any questions, ask here
17:25 &lt;BogdanVancea> Okay
17:25 &lt;BogdanVancea> Should I create a component/service for indexing from vcf files only?
17:26 &lt;BogdanVancea> Or do I need to integrate with anything else?
17:26 &lt;sdumitriu1> Just VCF files
17:27 &lt;BogdanVancea> Okay :))
17:27 &lt;sdumitriu1> There's obo2solr as an inspiration, but I'm not sure if it's that useful
17:28 &lt;sdumitriu1> And https://github.com/compbio-UofT/phenotips/blob/master/components/solr-access-service/src/main/java/edu/toronto/cs/phenotips/solr/HPOScriptService.java#L103
17:29 &lt;BogdanVancea> Thanks :)
17:29 &lt;BogdanVancea> I'll follow the same model then :)
17:30 &lt;BogdanVancea> Have you ever considered using spring for interfacing with the data?
17:30 &lt;BogdanVancea> For phenotips / medsavant
17:31 &lt;BogdanVancea> ?
17:31 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes, but it's a very big change right now
17:32 &lt;BogdanVancea> Yep, there are quite a few services in phenotips.
17:32 &lt;BogdanVancea> I was just curious :)
17:33 &lt;BogdanVancea> Well, I'm off to sleep aswell then! Thanks for the clarifications
17:34 &lt;sdumitriu1> You're welcome
17:34 &lt;BogdanVancea> Talk to you tomorrow :) good night!
17:34 &lt;sdumitriu1> Good night
