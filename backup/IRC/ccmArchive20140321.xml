07:11 &lt;groundnuty> sdumitriu_[Away]: Dear Sir, I'm writing a proposal for "Development of machine learning methods for modeling the evolution of tumors". The more I read into a cited paper the more I conclude that the main chalange will be to grasp the complexity of the created method - not the coding and optimization part
07:16 &lt;groundnuty> sdumitriu_[Away]: without a very good understanding of statistical methods and biology behind it its difficult to analyze the python codebase and propose a detailed architecture of the proposed solution
07:20 &lt;groundnuty> said that, I would like to ask: who are you looking for? a person with good statistical/biological background who understads the subject of cited article well, or a computer scientis/programer?

14:36 &lt;shalinshah1993> Oh and I also have this confusion what is difference between MedSavant and GenomeSavant since when open MedSavant it redirects us
14:37 &lt;shalinshah1993> to genomesavant
14:37 &lt;shalinshah1993> or are the interchangeable ?
