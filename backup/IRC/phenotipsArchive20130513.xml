13:14 &lt;sdumitriu> has joined #phenotips
13:15 &lt;sdumitriu> Hm, issues with my network as well
13:15 &lt;sdumitriu> So, kushalkhandelwal, what are you up to?
13:16 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Was without connectivity
13:16 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Trying to figure out alternative ways
13:16 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Would work on Xwiki issue
13:16 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> and issue 429 phenotips
13:18 &lt;sdumitriu> Building XWiki requires some changes to make Maven work properly: http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/Building
13:18 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Reading this http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/Contributing
13:18 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Oh ok
13:18 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> would follow this
13:19 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I have maven 3.0.4 on my system
13:35 &lt;kushalk124> has joined #phenotips

15:35 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Hey sdumitriu
15:35 &lt;sdumitriu> Hey
15:35 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Network problems today :x
15:36 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> How was your meeting ?
15:36 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> And how are the new interns ?
15:36 &lt;sdumitriu> Good
15:37 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> :)
15:37 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> So working on something today ? Busy ?
15:38 &lt;sdumitriu> Well, I'm always busy
15:38 &lt;sdumitriu> But I can make time for you
15:38 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> :D
15:39 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> My network ! not letting me work
15:39 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Planning to switch it
15:39 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Actually I am having 2 connections at home , and now I have to use WiFi which somehow is not working properly
15:39 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Anyways I was looking at this
15:39 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> https://github.com/compbio-UofT/phenotips/issues/429
15:40 &lt;sdumitriu> Stuck?
15:41 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> In DBWebhomesheet
15:41 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> "className"         : $patientClassName,
15:41 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> "translationPrefix" : "patient.livetable."
15:41 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I can see this
15:41 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> patient.livetable is appended in front of all column names
15:41 &lt;sdumitriu> Yep
15:42 &lt;sdumitriu> Did you find where the translations are defined?
15:42 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Looking for that
15:42 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> http://localhost:8080/bin/edit/PhenoTips/LiveTableResults
15:42 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Looking at this
15:42 &lt;sdumitriu> Well, it's simple
15:43 &lt;sdumitriu> Just search for patient.livetable. on the filesystem
15:43 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> How do I search that ?
15:43 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Oh yes
15:43 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I had to ask
15:43 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> how to search
15:43 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I look for different files and look in them
15:43 &lt;sdumitriu> You're on Linux, right?
15:43 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Yep
15:44 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I used to do that on github
15:44 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> is there a way in XWiki to search ?
15:44 &lt;sdumitriu> Yep
15:44 &lt;sdumitriu> http://localhost:8080/bin/Main/Search
15:45 &lt;sdumitriu> I use a nice little tool called Midnight Commander (mc)
15:45 &lt;sdumitriu> And it has the option to search files and look in the content
15:45 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Oh nice
15:48 &lt;sdumitriu> Found something?
15:48 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Yes
15:48 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I am looking in the translations page
15:49 &lt;sdumitriu> Good
15:51 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I need to define the ones which are not defined ?
15:51 &lt;sdumitriu> Yep
15:51 &lt;sdumitriu> You can usually get the texts from the class
15:52 &lt;sdumitriu> http://localhost:8080/bin/edit/PhenoTips/PatientClass?editor=class
15:52 &lt;sdumitriu> Not all of them should be added, though
15:52 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Oh
15:52 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> So which ones to be added ?
15:54 &lt;sdumitriu> The ones that would make sense in the livetable...
15:54 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Hm
15:54 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Ok
15:54 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> :)
15:54 &lt;sdumitriu> For example Notes not
15:54 &lt;sdumitriu> Pedigree not
15:54 &lt;sdumitriu> All the extended_ columns
15:54 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Why there are two identifier ?
15:54 &lt;sdumitriu> Indication for referral
15:55 &lt;sdumitriu> One is internal, the other external
15:55 &lt;sdumitriu> It depends which one is needed at the installation
15:55 &lt;sdumitriu> Some already have their patients in another application
15:56 &lt;sdumitriu> So they use an external identifier that we don't care about
15:56 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Ohh
15:56 &lt;sdumitriu> Others use PhenoTips as the main patient database, so they use the internal identifier
15:57 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Why don't we remove the irrelevant colums from Form configuration page
15:57 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> for livetable
15:57 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Oh
15:57 &lt;sdumitriu> Hm, we should, but it's not easy
15:57 &lt;sdumitriu> Since it just lists all the existing class properties
15:57 &lt;sdumitriu> And there's no way to specify that a property is searchable or not
15:58 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Hmm
16:00 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Do you remember that place
16:00 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> where I added one field to be enabled/disabled ?
16:00 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> This commit
16:00 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> https://github.com/compbio-UofT/phenotips/commit/afb62d6383361f991d12aea265de3fae4e63a049
16:01 &lt;sdumitriu> Yep
16:01 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Using this we enabled/disabled field in form ?
16:02 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> The option was available in the form configuration ?
16:02 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Now I remember it was
16:02 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes, it was
16:03 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I am thinking how to remove the irrelevant columns
16:03 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Will think more on this
16:03 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Because for the administrator everything is very cluttered
16:04 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Which page would contain the code for Form configuration page ?
16:05 &lt;sdumitriu> Hm, hard to say...
16:05 &lt;sdumitriu> Most of the code is in XWiki.AdminSheet
16:05 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Hmm
16:05 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> So it just runs a loop to display the columns ?
16:05 &lt;sdumitriu> But the display for those properties is in PhenoTips.DBConfigurationClassDisplayer
16:06 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
16:06 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> And how to use MC ? :P
16:06 &lt;sdumitriu> Did you install it?
16:06 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Yep
16:06 &lt;sdumitriu> Type mc
16:06 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Did that
16:06 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> looking in it
16:06 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> File explorer
16:06 &lt;sdumitriu> Look in the menus
16:07 &lt;sdumitriu> Comman -> Find file
16:07 &lt;sdumitriu> I know the key shortcuts, so I don't really know where to find things in the menu...
16:07 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Hehe
16:07 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I would learn them :)
16:08 &lt;sdumitriu> Plus, if you're on Ubuntu, I think their console application steals some important keys, like F10
16:08 &lt;sdumitriu> Alt+Shift+? opens the search dialog
16:08 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I am on Ubuntu
16:08 &lt;sdumitriu> And you can filter by file name and file content
16:08 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Which OS you use ?
16:08 &lt;sdumitriu> Gentoo
16:09 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Oh
16:09 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Never used it
16:09 &lt;sdumitriu> With KDE
16:09 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Installing it was such a pain when I tried last year :P
16:10 &lt;sdumitriu> What, Gentoo?
16:10 &lt;sdumitriu> Or KDE?
16:10 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> My laptops just boils on Linux
16:10 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Gentoo
16:10 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> There were some issues
16:10 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> The only reason we use Ubuntu is
16:10 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> We have a mirror of the repo
16:11 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> A local mirror
16:11 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> so installing and upgrading packages becomes easier
16:11 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> with our net
16:11 &lt;sdumitriu> Yeah, you need to know more about how a Linux OS works to be able to install Gentoo
16:11 &lt;sdumitriu> Yet they have the best documentation I've seen
16:11 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Hmm
16:12 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Would try it someday
16:12 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Any idea how can I control over heating of my laptop ??
16:12 &lt;sdumitriu> Ubuntu's is mostly a bunch of kids asking random question on a dozen or more forums
16:12 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I agree
16:13 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> But then it gets easier because of that
16:13 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Community support is good
16:13 &lt;sdumitriu> Since Gentoo requires some knowledge, most of the users are more advanced and organized, and can formulate a good question and a good answer
16:13 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Although the way they are commercializing it is sad
16:13 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I did install Arch once
16:13 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I liked it
16:15 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> in MC where it shows the results ?
16:19 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> It is 4 at your place temp 11 degree
16:19 &lt;kushalkhandelwal>  It is 1 AM at my place temp 29 degree :\
16:20 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Now I think even nights are hot
16:45 &lt;sdumitriu> 1AM, and still up?
16:46 &lt;sdumitriu> More like 2:30 now
18:06 &lt;sdumitriu> has quit
19:05 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> has quit
19:20 &lt;sdumitriu1> has quit
19:21 &lt;sdumitriu> has joined #phenotips

21:39 &lt;Guest24849> is now known as &lt;kushalk124>
21:39 &lt;kushalk124> clear
21:39 &lt;kushalk124> Hey sdumitriu
21:39 &lt;sdumitriu> Hey
21:39 &lt;sdumitriu> Up already?
21:40 &lt;sdumitriu> Good morning
21:40 &lt;kushalk124> Yes
21:40 &lt;kushalk124> Good morning
21:40 &lt;kushalk124> My mom thought I slept early so she woke me up
21:41 &lt;kushalk124> What you upto ?
21:41 &lt;kushalk124> Working on something ?
21:41 &lt;sdumitriu> Scoring GSoC proposals
21:41 &lt;sdumitriu> Got the email?
21:42 &lt;kushalk124> Yes
21:42 &lt;kushalk124> Reading it :)
21:42 &lt;kushalk124> Just saw that
21:44 &lt;kushalk124> Is tuesday a hard deadline ?
21:44 &lt;sdumitriu> Nope
21:45 &lt;kushalk124> As I am not available from 16th to 20
21:45 &lt;kushalk124> I would start working today only
21:46 &lt;kushalk124> Yayy new task :)
21:50 &lt;kushalk124> How are all the proposals ?
21:50 &lt;kushalk124> And you didn't tell me about the new interns
21:52 &lt;sdumitriu> Well, there are about 10 proposals that we'd like to accept, but we're lacking the slots and the mentors to do that
21:53 &lt;sdumitriu> There are 8 that are really good
21:53 &lt;sdumitriu> 6 that we
21:53 &lt;sdumitriu> 'd really want to accept
21:53 &lt;kushalk124> :)
21:54 &lt;sdumitriu> 4 that I think are really important
21:54 &lt;sdumitriu> Or 5?
21:54 &lt;kushalk124> Ohh
21:54 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes, 5
21:54 &lt;sdumitriu> And that have good chances of success
21:54 &lt;kushalk124> The important ones are ?
21:54 &lt;kushalk124> I think one would be mobile app
21:54 &lt;sdumitriu> Secret
21:54 &lt;kushalk124> hehe :D
21:55 &lt;sdumitriu> Now we'll see which of these 5 finish their tasks
21:55 &lt;kushalk124> Ohh
21:56 &lt;kushalk124> Task is very imp
21:56 &lt;kushalk124> I will try to work in 2 days only , from 16th I wont be having laptop also :(
22:28 &lt;kushalk124> sdumitriu, Busy ?
22:29 &lt;sdumitriu> Shoot
22:30 &lt;kushalk124> So in the measurement section we would have a dropbox to select the unit system ?
22:30 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
22:30 &lt;sdumitriu> Or radios
22:30 &lt;kushalk124> If imperial selected we would change the field inputs along with the labels ?
22:31 &lt;kushalk124> But the value to server would pe passed in Imperial only ?
22:31 &lt;sdumitriu> No, metric only
22:31 &lt;kushalk124> So if we pass that in metric
22:31 &lt;kushalk124> But the user chose imperial
22:32 &lt;kushalk124> When he would export PDF
22:32 &lt;kushalk124> then ?
22:32 &lt;kushalk124> Would it be in imperial or metric ?
22:32 &lt;sdumitriu> Imperial, but don't worry about that
22:32 &lt;sdumitriu> That's a different task
22:32 &lt;kushalk124> I was just thinking about that :)
22:32 &lt;sdumitriu> And there are a few other related tasks
22:32 &lt;kushalk124> Ok
22:33 &lt;sdumitriu> But the most important one is allowing users to enter data in those units
22:33 &lt;kushalk124> Yep
22:34 &lt;sdumitriu> (actually doctors don't care about imperial units, it's just that they receive old measurements from smaller regional hospitals that don't know metric, but they don't want to convert themselves to metric)
22:35 &lt;sdumitriu> (so it's OK if after the data is entered and converted to metric, it will only be displayed as metric from that point on)
22:35 &lt;sdumitriu> When we'll get users asking for imperial display, we might add support for that as well
22:36 &lt;sdumitriu> But don't take this the wrong way, it's very good that you're thinking about this
22:36 &lt;sdumitriu> A good software engineer should always think about all the implications of a choice
22:41 &lt;kushalk124> :)
22:42 &lt;kushalk124> I was thinking what other changes needs to be implemented if we switch to imperial
22:42 &lt;sdumitriu> has quit
22:42 &lt;sdumitriu> has joined #phenotips
22:42 &lt;kushalk124> I wanted to ask one more thing
22:43 &lt;kushalk124> Not related to this task
22:43 &lt;sdumitriu> Shoot
22:44 &lt;kushalk124> How is the anonymized patient phenotype data collected ?
22:44 &lt;sdumitriu> Simple
22:45 &lt;kushalk124> And how is the data used ?
22:45 &lt;sdumitriu> Right now big hospitals already have a huge EHR software package where they securely hold private data
22:46 &lt;sdumitriu> Then they use phenotips as a side project where they don't enter any PII (Personally identifiable information), just phenotypes
22:47 &lt;sdumitriu> And they use the "external identifier" field that we talked about to say which patient from the private EHR is described here
22:47 &lt;kushalk124> Oh
22:47 &lt;sdumitriu> Then this data can be shared between research institutions, since it's just abstract data which can't be used to identify individuals
22:48 &lt;kushalk124> In UofT lab this data is used for research ? To study about genetic diseases ?
22:48 &lt;kushalk124> How is that done ?
22:48 &lt;sdumitriu> The main kind of usage that we see for PhenoTips right now is for large collaborative studies for identifying rare diseases
22:49 &lt;sdumitriu> And we mean rare
22:49 &lt;sdumitriu> Like, one-two cases per country
22:49 &lt;kushalk124> I have a great interest in how ML and ANN can be used in medicinal purposes
22:49 &lt;kushalk124> As in I have a good interest in Data
22:49 &lt;sdumitriu> When you have so few people with a disease, there's very little that one doctor can do
22:49 &lt;kushalk124> how it can utilized to gather some useful information
22:49 &lt;kushalk124> Yep
22:50 &lt;sdumitriu> But when pooling together resources from different countries, it's more likely to be able to pinpoint the genetic mutations that affect all the individuals
22:50 &lt;kushalk124> Rare diseases
22:50 &lt;kushalk124> and mutations
22:51 &lt;sdumitriu> The problem is that there is no such thing as a "standard" genome
22:51 &lt;sdumitriu> Everybody has many variations
22:51 &lt;sdumitriu> And we haven't analyzed enough genomes to see what is good and what is bad
22:52 &lt;sdumitriu> So it's almost impossible to say just from one individual which of the thousands of differences from the few reference genomes that we have is the likely cause for some symptoms
22:53 &lt;kushalk124> Yep you need more data on that
22:53 &lt;kushalk124> To be more accurate you need more data
22:53 &lt;sdumitriu> Right
22:53 &lt;kushalk124> and hence PhenoTips
22:53 &lt;sdumitriu> Once you have good data, you can put different teams to work on it
22:54 &lt;sdumitriu> A team in our lab is studying "copy number variations"
22:54 &lt;sdumitriu> That means that the DNA is not just a unique chain, it's normal for many regions to be present in several copies
22:55 &lt;sdumitriu> And having more or less copies than it's "normal" affects the body
22:55 &lt;sdumitriu> The problem is that with the current sequencing machines it's hard to detect CNVs
22:55 &lt;sdumitriu> Since sequencing is already done by multiplying thousands of times each piece of DNA
22:56 &lt;kushalk124> Hm
22:56 &lt;kushalk124> Yes , you have to replicate data
22:57 &lt;sdumitriu> OK, I'm going to sleep
22:57 &lt;sdumitriu> How's the progress on the translations issue?
22:57 &lt;kushalk124> So we detect the variations ?
22:57 &lt;kushalk124> Oh ok :)
22:58 &lt;kushalk124> Will complete it today
22:58 &lt;kushalk124> I slept yesterday while working on it :P
22:58 &lt;kushalk124> At home it gets hard to be awake :D
22:58 &lt;sdumitriu> K
22:58 &lt;sdumitriu> Bye
22:58 &lt;kushalk124> 1 more week at home
22:58 &lt;kushalk124> Ok
22:58 &lt;kushalk124> Bye
22:58 &lt;kushalk124> Good night :)</content>
