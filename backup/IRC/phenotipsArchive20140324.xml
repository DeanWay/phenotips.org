14:54 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: I took a look at what you are asking me to do. I'm not clear on everything though.
15:14 &lt;akats> Would you like me to turn sections in the word document (for example Corpus Callosum, which has 4 conditions listed under it), into subsections in the PhenoTips list? The subsections in PhenoTips require and HPO term as the id, and they are not provided, but I shouldn't have too much trouble finding the right terms through Solr.
15:14 &lt;sdumitriu> Not yet
15:14 &lt;sdumitriu> The issue is that items in a subsectition are not expandable
15:14 &lt;sdumitriu> That's a bug that needs fixing
15:15 &lt;akats> Oh, I see
15:16 &lt;sdumitriu> But ideally yes, those should be subsections
15:16 &lt;sdumitriu> And the ID is not required
15:16 &lt;sdumitriu> It's not used at all actually
15:17 &lt;sdumitriu> (for subsection titles)
15:24 &lt;vijay13> has quit
15:29 &lt;SayAsh_> has quit
15:46 &lt;vijay13> has quit
16:25 &lt;akats> I think I might have found a bug in PhenoTips, but can't say for sure because it's in the form preview, rather than on the full patient record
16:27 &lt;shalinshah1993> has quit
16:57 &lt;akats> so the bug that we were looking at is "partial" bug. Also I think I found another bug.

17:33 &lt;akats> how do you want the file. Just the json, xar zip, or maven formatted xml?
17:35 &lt;akats> I tried checking the terms, but its a bit hard when they are not named the same as on the list
17:43 &lt;sdumitriu> You should put the mapping on dev.phenotips.org
17:44 &lt;akats> I don't have admin access
17:45 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes you do
17:47 &lt;shalinshah1993> has quit
17:53 &lt;akats> http://dev.phenotips.org/bin/PhenoTips/Neuro+Skeletal. I can't guarantee that I didn't miss something, but I did try double checking.
17:53 &lt;sdumitriu> OK, thank you
18:39 &lt;akats> has quit
