12:18 &lt;bvancea> hey sdumitriu1
12:19 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hey
12:19 &lt;sdumitriu1> How's it going?
12:19 &lt;bvancea> pretty good
12:19 &lt;bvancea> just came back from the conference
12:19 &lt;sdumitriu1> How was the conference?
12:19 &lt;bvancea> like 20 minutes ago
12:19 &lt;bvancea> it was really nice
12:19 &lt;bvancea> a really good practice for my diploma exam
12:20 &lt;bvancea> some of the other presentation were also nice
12:20 &lt;bvancea> there was this invited guest who was kind of boring
12:20 &lt;bvancea> but it was nice overall
12:21 &lt;bvancea> and how is your day?
12:25 &lt;bvancea> hmmm, a little of topic, they've changed github a bit
12:29 &lt;sdumitriu1> Fixed a bug
12:30 &lt;sdumitriu1> Good so far
12:30 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes, I've seen the changes since a few days
12:30 &lt;bvancea> hmm, I think I liked the old design more
12:31 &lt;sdumitriu1> It'
12:31 &lt;bvancea> this one is a little faster I guess, less ajax
12:31 &lt;sdumitriu1> s harder to find things now, until I get used to it
12:31 &lt;sdumitriu1> But I think it has a little more space for longer text
12:31 &lt;bvancea> yeah
12:32 &lt;bvancea> that minimalist design
12:32 &lt;bvancea> with buttons/menus being just icons
12:32 &lt;bvancea> and no text
12:32 &lt;bvancea> is a little confusing for me
12:32 &lt;bvancea> but its sort of a trend these days
12:33 &lt;bvancea> anyway, I'll be working on the variant parser/indexer
12:33 &lt;bvancea> its waaaay to slow
12:34 &lt;bvancea> I've checked it a couple of this last night, the lowest time I got was around 15 minutes for around 200k variants
12:34 &lt;bvancea> which is annoyingly slow
12:35 &lt;bvancea> I think my mistake might come from the fact that I'm adding one variant at a time to the SolrServer class
12:36 &lt;bvancea> and I think that actually sends some data to solr
12:36 &lt;bvancea> even if its not commited
12:36 &lt;bvancea> I should group some variants before adding them
12:38 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
12:40 &lt;bvancea> I'm not sure how I thought it doesn't send the file to solr
12:41 &lt;bvancea> since if it didn't, I should have gotten an out of memory exception
13:04 &lt;bvancea> nice, a lot of commits today
13:04 &lt;bvancea> :D
14:28 &lt;bvancea> so I've added a buffer for the variants in the indexing service
14:28 &lt;bvancea> and I only send the documents to solr when I reach a certain number of variants
14:28 &lt;bvancea> and now it takes around 40-50 seconds to index the 200k variants
14:28 &lt;sdumitriu1> Much better
14:29 &lt;bvancea> I'm gonna play with the buffer size a bit
14:29 &lt;bvancea> see how much I can give it without having to add extra space to the jvm memory
14:30 &lt;bvancea> I've got 42 seconds for a buffer size of 1500
