12:46 &lt;jim^^> meatcar - hi.  How is it going with the MedSavant development?  Did you have any questions?
12:51 &lt;meatcar> jim^^: its going good. I am in the process of fixing the VCF upload and queueing mechanisms. I know you are re-writing the annotation pipeline, I wanted to make sure we aren't overlapping too much.
12:52 &lt;jim^^> OK, sounds like we should have a discussion.  My rewrite probably doesn't change functionality, it's more of a reorganization (but one that requires a lot of rewriting), so there's probably a way we can both work on this
12:52 &lt;jim^^> I can come in today
12:54 &lt;jim^^> I can be there in 30 mins - 1 hour
12:55 &lt;meatcar> sure, sounds good. FYI, theres no room around my desk, we might have to find another space where we can sit together.
12:55 &lt;jim^^> OK, maybe I'll aim to get there at around 2pm, and then hopefully the common space by the kitchen won't be too busy and we can just talk there
12:58 &lt;meatcar> ok, see you then.
13:46 &lt;jim^^> leaving now
