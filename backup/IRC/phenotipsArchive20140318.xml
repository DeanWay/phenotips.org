15:42 &lt;aw1231> sdumitiru_[Away]: I am unsure how to continue to work on my application.  It seems like most of the work has been done, and the work that is requested is nearly impossible.  I am considering withdrawing.
16:01 &lt;sdumitriu_[Away]&gt; is now known as &lt;sdumitriu>
16:01 &lt;sdumitriu> Hey aw1231
16:01 &lt;sdumitriu> Why do you say it's nearly impossible?
16:13 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: Would you like to see a magic trick when you have some free time? And by magic trick, I mean some ridiculous code.

16:20 &lt;nclandrei> hi everyone !
16:21 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi nclandrei
16:28 &lt;nclandrei> how are things going?
16:28 &lt;nclandrei> because I will send you a more detailed draft tonight or tomorrow, currently working on it!
16:28 &lt;sdumitriu> Almost ready for a new release
16:31 &lt;nclandrei> ooh, good news
16:32 &lt;nclandrei> congrats!
16:43 &lt;nclandrei> if everything happens, I am here, just ping me :D
16:48 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: Which http client do we use? I've asked you before, but I think I misheard you, because I have HTTPD written down, which is a server.
16:49 &lt;sdumitriu> org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient
16:49 &lt;akats> Thank you
17:03 &lt;akats> https://github.com/soLEED/misc/blob/master/src/ethnicityParser.java

17:19 &lt;nclandrei_> sorry for that, back again
17:20 &lt;akats> I don't completely understand the scoring in the debug output, but my guess is that the strength of the default boost is not enough. Log10 of the population brings down a difference of 8 million to 40 points.
17:20 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes, was just looking at that
17:22 &lt;akats> Actually currently it's not log10
17:22 &lt;akats> its log10 which is then brought up to the power of 3
17:23 &lt;nclandrei> has quit
17:36 &lt;sdumitriu> akats: Actually it's almost normal for Asante to be so high
17:36 &lt;sdumitriu> They have roughly the same population as ashkenazi
17:38 &lt;akats> It still needs to be fixed, or no?
17:38 &lt;sdumitriu> Hold on

19:49 &lt;nclandrei> yeey, I am very happy, just finished the proposal (-:
19:50 &lt;nclandrei> sdumitriu, should I send it to you on email?
19:51 &lt;sdumitriu> Submit it through Melange
19:51 &lt;nclandrei> okay, I shall do that
19:51 &lt;nclandrei> so I only have to put it there?
19:51 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
19:51 &lt;nclandrei> okay, thank you!
