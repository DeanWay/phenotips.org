09:02 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Hey sdumitriu1
09:05 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi
09:06 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Any bugs to solve today ?
09:07 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Would complete the proposal today , I have a holiday tomorrow
09:09 &lt;sdumitriu> Well, there's #399 to finish, and if you want to learn a bit of Maven, #407
09:13 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Would try :)
09:14 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Oh 399 I didnt do that day
09:15 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Sorry forgot that , while we were working on Travis
09:15 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> You also have to tell me why why Jenkins is better
09:15 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> 407 I saw the day you opened it
09:15 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> When should the line be displayed ?
09:16 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> When we start Phenotips  using start.sh ?
09:16 &lt;sdumitriu> When you run start.sh
09:16 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> So we have to write one echo line ?
09:16 &lt;sdumitriu> After the line that says Started SelectChannelConnector@0.0.0.0:8080
09:16 &lt;sdumitriu> Nope
09:17 &lt;sdumitriu> echo won't work
09:17 &lt;sdumitriu> Since java is still running
09:17 &lt;sdumitriu> Look at the link I put in the description
09:17 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Oh
09:18 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Looking at it
09:18 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I dont like Jira :|
10:09 &lt;ravigarg27> has quit
10:48 &lt;soul> has joined #phenotips
10:50 &lt;soul> hi..I have successfully build phenotips but when i try to start the jetty server I get -" Unable to access jarfile jetty/start.jar"
10:54 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hi soul
10:55 &lt;soul> hello
10:55 &lt;sdumitriu1> On Linux?
10:55 &lt;soul> nope
10:55 &lt;soul> windows
10:55 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hm...
10:56 &lt;sdumitriu1> OK, edit start.bat
10:56 &lt;sdumitriu1> And at the end, replace %JETTY_HOME%/start.jar with %JETTY_HOME%\start.jar
10:56 &lt;sdumitriu1> See if that fixes it
11:01 &lt;soul> it doesnt
11:01 &lt;soul> do I have to install jetty separately
11:01 &lt;soul> ?
11:04 &lt;sdumitriu1> No
11:04 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hm, let me try this
11:09 &lt;soul> The folder "jetty" in the package formed is empty
11:10 &lt;sdumitriu1> Ah
11:12 &lt;sdumitriu1> Then something went wrong during the build
11:15 &lt;soul> I ran in no-snapshot-update mode
11:15 &lt;soul> can that be the problem?
11:18 &lt;sdumitriu1> Could be
11:18 &lt;sdumitriu1> Although I doubt it
11:23 &lt;soul> let me run it again
11:23 &lt;soul> although it would take time
11:24 &lt;soul> as my internet connection is a bit slow
11:31 &lt;ravigarg27> has quit
11:47 &lt;sdumitriu1> soul: A second build shouldn't take that much time
11:47 &lt;soul> has quit
11:48 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> sdumitriu1:
11:49 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> How can I change the port at which my server starts
11:49 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> ?
11:49 &lt;sdumitriu1> Pass it as the first parameter
11:49 &lt;sdumitriu1> ./start.sh 9090
11:50 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I think we should change the default port at which the server starts
11:50 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> For many people
11:50 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> They have apache servers installed
11:51 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Which by default run at 8080
11:51 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> So it might conflict
11:52 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Also other web services , If i run a LAMP stack it runs at 8080
11:52 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> so it conflicts
11:53 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hm, I don't fully agree
11:53 &lt;sdumitriu1> Actually I don't fully disagree
11:53 &lt;sdumitriu1> Apache httpd should runs at 80 most of the time
11:53 &lt;sdumitriu1> Tomcat runs at 8080
11:53 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Apache runs at 80
11:53 &lt;sdumitriu1> But if someone has Tomcat running, he should put PhenoTips inside Tomcat
11:54 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> tomcat runs at 8080
11:55 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> If we use Tomcat
11:55 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> For this we are using jetty
11:55 &lt;sdumitriu1> If someone has Tomcat running, then that's not a simple user machine where the standalone package for dummies should be tried
11:55 &lt;sdumitriu1> 8080 is not the port where Tomcat runs
11:55 &lt;sdumitriu1> By definition, it's the alternative http port
11:56 &lt;sdumitriu1> Where the alternative HTTP server is supposed to run
11:56 &lt;sdumitriu1> Jetty is an alternative HTTP server
11:56 &lt;sdumitriu1> So we're right
11:56 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Tomcat by default runs at ?
11:56 &lt;sdumitriu1> It's the user's problem to manage several servers
11:56 &lt;sdumitriu1> 8080
11:56 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Ok so I just installed tomcat
11:57 &lt;sdumitriu1> Any alternative HTTP server is supposed to run at 8080
11:57 &lt;sdumitriu1> But users aren't supposed to have more than one
11:57 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Now my phenotips wont run at 8080
11:57 &lt;sdumitriu1> It's redundant to have both Tomcat and Jetty running at the same time
11:57 &lt;sdumitriu1> brb
11:57 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I stopped tomcat still it doesnt not run on 8080
11:57 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> ok
12:01 &lt;sdumitriu1> netstat -ltpn
12:01 &lt;froggy> has quit
12:02 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I did that
12:02 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> 9306/java        tcp6       0      0 :::8080
12:03 &lt;sdumitriu1> ps 9306
12:03 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Why I am not able to kill the process
12:03 &lt;sdumitriu1> ps 9306
12:04 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> 9306 pts/3    Tl     0:24 java -Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=192m -Dxwiki.data.dir=d
12:05 &lt;sdumitriu1> So that's a Jetty running there
12:06 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Hm
12:06 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> But I can't open my server
12:07 &lt;sdumitriu1> Find out where it was started
12:07 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> ?
12:07 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I started one at 9090
12:08 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> before that was on 8080
12:08 &lt;sdumitriu1> kill -9 9306
12:09 &lt;sdumitriu1> Still running?
12:10 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> 9306 pts/3    Z      0:24 [java] &lt;defunct>
12:10 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Now working
12:11 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> No its not working
12:18 &lt;froggy> has quit
12:19 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Can you help me with https://github.com/compbio-UofT/phenotips/issues/399
12:19 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> The homepage is read only ?
12:20 &lt;camelia_> has quit
12:21 &lt;sdumitriu1> Did you follow the steps to reproduce?
12:21 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Yes reproduced
12:21 &lt;sdumitriu1> Then what's your question?
12:22 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> it's just the homepage that is read-only ?
12:22 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> If I remove hasedit it would work for all
12:23 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
12:23 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> If I change it with hasWatch
12:23 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> It would work for all
12:23 &lt;sdumitriu1> Why hasWatch?
12:23 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> and not show for not logged in users
12:23 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> We dont want the users to see the button when they havent logged in
12:23 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> So if I check for authentication
12:23 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> That should do
12:23 &lt;sdumitriu1> No, we don't want to show the button when they're not allowed to create patients
12:24 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Hmm
12:25 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> All the users allowed to create record ?
12:25 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> *not allowed
12:27 &lt;sdumitriu1> Right
12:27 &lt;sdumitriu1> "show the create button if the user can create"
12:27 &lt;sdumitriu1> Where did you find hasWatch?
12:28 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Was reading the documentation for Xwiki today
12:29 &lt;sdumitriu1> Find where hasEdit is defined
12:30 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Looking for it
12:30 &lt;sdumitriu1> It's on the filesystem
12:30 &lt;sdumitriu1> somewhere
12:30 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Hmm
12:30 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Need to find the file
12:33 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Can I edit the template from within the wiki ?
12:33 &lt;sdumitriu1> Which template?
12:34 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> It should be defined in some template
12:34 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Let me find which
12:34 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> some page should be defining rights
12:34 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> AdminRightsSheet page
12:34 &lt;sdumitriu1> Nope
12:34 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> says rightsui.vm
12:34 &lt;sdumitriu1> You're going in the wrong direction
12:35 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Ohh
12:35 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> It is not the global rights ?
12:35 &lt;sdumitriu1> It's not about how rights are defined
12:35 &lt;sdumitriu1> It's just a variable initialized with a value that does reflect the rights
12:35 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I was thinking
12:35 &lt;sdumitriu1> You need to find the variable, not the rights
12:35 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> somewhere it should have been set($hasEdit
12:36 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
12:36 &lt;sdumitriu1> But there can be a space between "set" and "("
12:36 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I was finding that only
12:37 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> So it is being set in some file
12:38 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
12:38 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Trying to figure out which file
12:39 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I cant find any rights file
12:39 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> nor access level file
12:39 &lt;sdumitriu1> It's not related to rights
12:40 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Oh
12:46 &lt;ravigarg27> has quit
12:46 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> so all the variables are defined in that file ?
12:46 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> as in initialized
12:46 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> and its for phenotips ?
12:46 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> not on xwiki
12:46 &lt;sdumitriu1> Not all, but most
12:46 &lt;sdumitriu1> It's for XWiki
12:46 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Ohh
12:47 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hint: it's in webapps/phenotips/templates/
12:49 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Ohh I had found earlier the right template
12:50 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> xwikivars.vm ?
12:50 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yep
12:50 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> :\
12:51 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I had found it earlier
12:51 &lt;sdumitriu1> Now, what variable in there seems helpful
12:51 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Read it in morning
12:52 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Hmm
12:52 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> wait
12:52 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> let me read
12:53 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> $hasCreateSpace
12:53 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> or $hasCreatePage
12:53 &lt;sdumitriu1> Which one is it?
12:53 &lt;sdumitriu1> :)
12:53 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I think create page $hasCreatePage
12:53 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
12:53 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> :)
12:54 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> When you told me that I am going in wrong direction
12:54 &lt;sdumitriu1> OK, now let's see if you can fix it in just one commit
12:54 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I thought it has nothing to do with templates :P
12:54 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> So I was checking internal pages
12:54 &lt;sdumitriu1> Sorry for misleading you
12:54 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> with Ctrl + G
12:54 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> :P
12:54 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Not your mistake
12:54 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> My useful resource http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Scripting
12:55 &lt;sdumitriu1> I was saying you're going in the wrong direction -> AdminRightsSheet
12:55 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Yes
12:55 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Thats why you asked me how I know about hasWatch
12:55 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> :P
12:56 &lt;sdumitriu1> Well, $hasCreatePage is listed on that page...
12:56 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Haan I saw that
12:57 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I thought initially I need to check only authentication
12:58 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Oops Mixed a bit  of hindi over there :P
13:13 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> How we did rebase ?
13:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> git status
13:13 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> git pull --rebase ?
13:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> Which branch are you on?
13:13 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I created a new branch
13:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes, it should be git pull --rebase if you're on master
13:14 &lt;sdumitriu1> If you're on a new branch, you can do:
13:14 &lt;sdumitriu1> git fetch upstream &amp;&amp; git rebase upstream/master
13:14 &lt;sdumitriu1> I think...
13:14 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> You had merged my change for hasedit ?
13:15 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I fetched it
13:15 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> and rebase
13:15 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> it says its uptodate
13:15 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> but when I am editing I dont see my that edit
13:16 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I added upstream also ( I deleted my .gitconfig ) :P
13:17 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> git add upstream https://github.com/compbio-UofT/phenotips
13:20 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> sdumitriu1: ?
13:21 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
13:24 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Why are my files not getting updated with master
13:27 &lt;sdumitriu1> WDYM?
13:28 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I opened the file in editor
13:28 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> It doesn't shows the last commits
13:28 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I made
13:29 &lt;ravigarg27> has quit
13:29 &lt;sdumitriu1> git status
13:30 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> nothing to commit
13:31 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I didnt change
13:31 &lt;sdumitriu1> git reflog
13:33 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> http://pastebin.com/YbJ53CSy
13:35 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> He has to change in http://localhost:8080/bin/edit/PhenoTips/FPhenotypeMapping ?
13:35 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Replace HP:0001263", "HP:0000708", "HP:0001286" this with HP:0011446 ?
13:35 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> sdumitriu1: ?
13:35 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> the bug you gave to ravigarg ?
