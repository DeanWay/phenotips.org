00:39 &lt;sdumitriu> Hey groundnuty
00:40 &lt;sdumitriu> Those projects are fairly popular, so I guess you'll have to do your best to impress the mentors
00:42 &lt;sdumitriu> A detailed (and correct) architecture shows that you've given serious though to the problem, you understand what needs to be done, and have a good approach to it
00:44 &lt;sdumitriu> A proper timeline shows that you have experience with developing large projects and understand the project development lifecycle, you have experience with the usual roadblocks, etc
00:44 &lt;sdumitriu> ruthgrace: Did you set a root password?
00:50 &lt;ruthgrace> no, not for mysql
00:51 &lt;ruthgrace> @sdumitriu, if I don't have experience developing large projects, am I very unlikely to get in? Asha's project is the only one that looks really cool to me.
00:52 &lt;woohee> has left #ccm
00:54 &lt;sdumitriu> ruthgrace: You don't need to create databases outside MedSavant
00:54 &lt;sdumitriu> Just start the server, then you can create a new database from within the client login screen
00:54 &lt;sdumitriu> It's OK if you don't have experience with big projects
00:54 &lt;ruthgrace> So I can give it any name I want?
00:54 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
00:55 &lt;ruthgrace> thanks :) I hope Asha and the rest of the mentors reviewing my proposal are OK with it too
00:55 &lt;sdumitriu> One of the goals of GSoC is to give students the oportunity to learn this
00:55 &lt;sdumitriu> So it's not a requirement
00:55 &lt;ruthgrace> That's a relief!
00:55 &lt;sdumitriu> It's just a plus for projects with a lot of proposals
00:56 &lt;ruthgrace> hopefully no one applies to Asha's project. :D
00:56 &lt;ruthgrace> Is the 2-4 student limit for Sick Kids CCM a pretty hard limit?
00:56 &lt;ruthgrace> Or would you guys be willing to take more students than that?
00:57 &lt;sdumitriu> It's not a hard limit
00:58 &lt;sdumitriu> It depends on the combination of students, projects and mentors
00:58 &lt;sdumitriu> 2-4 was originally set when only MedSavant and PhenoTips were considered
00:59 &lt;sdumitriu> But now we also have Quaid's 2 projects, Asha's, and Ron's
00:59 &lt;sdumitriu> So that's 4 more mentors
00:59 &lt;sdumitriu> But we'll see
00:59 &lt;ruthgrace> Sounds great !
00:59 &lt;sdumitriu> Oh, also, the number of slots that Google gives us
00:59 &lt;ruthgrace> How many is that?
01:00 &lt;sdumitriu> We don't know
01:00 &lt;sdumitriu> It's up to them
01:00 &lt;ruthgrace> I see.
01:00 &lt;ruthgrace> When  I try to change my root password, I get this:
01:00 &lt;ruthgrace> sudo mysqladmin -u root password 'ruthspassword' mysqladmin: connect to server at 'localhost' failed error: 'Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)'
01:02 &lt;sdumitriu> It's usually -p
01:02 &lt;sdumitriu> Not "password"
01:03 &lt;sdumitriu> And either no space between -p and the password, as in -pruthpassword
01:03 &lt;sdumitriu> Or no password at all, in which case you'll be promted to enter it
01:04 &lt;sdumitriu> Oh, wait, you're tryig to set it, not enter it
01:04 &lt;sdumitriu> Maybe it's already set
01:04 &lt;ruthgrace> I think it worked
01:04 &lt;ruthgrace> I typed in
01:04 &lt;ruthgrace> sudo mysqladmin -u root -p password
01:04 &lt;ruthgrace> and it prompted me for a new password
01:04 &lt;ruthgrace> and to confirm it
01:04 &lt;ruthgrace> well, I'll see if it works with MedSavant in a moment!
01:10 &lt;ruthgrace> Hmmm, I tried connecting to a server, and got an Array Out of Bounds error
01:10 &lt;ruthgrace> and a dialog popped up saying that the log in failed
01:13 &lt;ruthgrace> Do you get this error if you try to make a new database?
01:14 &lt;ruthgrace> ERROR org.ut.biolab.medsavant.client.view.list.ListView  - Unable to load list.
01:15 &lt;sdumitriu> I think that error was fixed earlier today
01:15 &lt;sdumitriu> Try to pull changes and rebuild
01:24 &lt;ruthgrace> Thank you! It's not having the array out of bounds exception any more. I'm still not able to log in, though
01:34 &lt;ruthgrace> hey, its a null pointer exception !
01:34 &lt;ruthgrace> 2014-03-19 01:34:02,438 3552 [AWT-EventQueue-0] INFO  org.ut.biolab.medsavant.client.login.LoginController  - Starting session... java.lang.NullPointerException 	at org.ut.biolab.medsavant.client.login.LoginController.finishLogin(LoginController.java:130)
01:52 &lt;ruthgrace> Maybe because I didn't open the ports
02:06 &lt;ruthgrace> No, I think the ports are being used by MedSavant
02:09 &lt;ruthgrace> Do I need a special user name and password?
02:09 &lt;ruthgrace> that's different from my root mysql credentials?
02:09 &lt;ruthgrace> (to log into the MedSavant client)
02:10 &lt;sdumitriu> Hm, hold on
02:10 &lt;sdumitriu> Are you using mysql or mysql-ib?
02:10 &lt;sdumitriu> mysqladmin will set the mysql password
02:10 &lt;sdumitriu> Those are different things
02:11 &lt;ruthgrace> oh. ICE is using mysql-ib, right ?
02:11 &lt;sdumitriu> Different servers running on different ports
02:11 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
02:11 &lt;sdumitriu> Not sure if it has a mysqladmin-ib utility or not...
02:15 &lt;ruthgrace> there is this:
02:15 &lt;ruthgrace>  /usr/local/infobright-4.0.7-x86_64/bin/mysql_secure_installation
02:15 &lt;ruthgrace> that lets you set the root password
02:23 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes, I used that myself
02:30 &lt;ruthgrace> I think I had set it before but didn't run sudo updatedb ... I am silly.
02:31 &lt;ruthgrace> Aw, the log in is still failing, though.
02:32 &lt;ruthgrace> I tested the ports and was able to echo back and forth from the server/client. Hmm. I'll figure it out later. Thanks sdumitriu! and good night.
