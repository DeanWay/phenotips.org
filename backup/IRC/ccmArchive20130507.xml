11:24 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes

14:52 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hm, so we only have 2 slots
14:54 &lt;BogdanVancea> welcome back
14:54 &lt;BogdanVancea> I thought there were more slots :(
14:54 &lt;sdumitriu1> I didn't say anything, just Hello
14:54 &lt;BogdanVancea> ah
14:54 &lt;sdumitriu1> How are you?
14:55 &lt;BogdanVancea> good, finishing up some tests for my Bachelor project
14:55 &lt;sdumitriu1> We might get more
14:55 &lt;BogdanVancea> and you?
14:55 &lt;sdumitriu1> We might get more slots
14:55 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Hm, so we only have 2 slots ????
14:55 &lt;sdumitriu1> Well, a bit disapointed
14:55 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Slots released ?
14:57 &lt;BogdanVancea> yeah, too bad
14:57 &lt;BogdanVancea> there are a lot of interesting possible projects
14:57 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> BogdanVancea:  Slots released ?
14:57 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> And only 2 ?
14:58 &lt;BogdanVancea> kushalkahndelwal, sdumitriu1 just said
14:58 &lt;BogdanVancea> there are only 2 slots available
14:58 &lt;BogdanVancea> I don't have much information
14:58 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Hmm
15:00 &lt;sdumitriu1> Now, since I'm the org admin for XWiki, and XWiki got 4 slots and we're not going to need them, I can transfer two slots to CCM
15:03 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Yes
15:03 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> you can do that
15:04 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> XWiki got 4
15:04 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> How many you applied for ?
15:04 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> From #gsoc
15:04 &lt;kushalkhandelwal>  &lt;@carols> manugupt1_: it's a first come first serve basis unless the org giving back the slots specifies what org for it to go to
15:05 &lt;sdumitriu1> XWiki applied for 2-4
15:05 &lt;sdumitriu1> We got all that we requested
15:05 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Nice
15:05 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Strange they gave only 2 to CCM
15:05 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Is it because the org is new ?
15:06 &lt;sdumitriu1> Which is normal, since XWiki is a veteran organization with a very good record
15:06 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes, probably because it's new
15:06 &lt;BogdanVancea> I see
15:06 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> You spoke to someone from google open source office ?
15:06 &lt;sdumitriu1> About what?
15:06 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> About slots
15:06 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Why so low
15:07 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> As in there was a case with Octave , they didn;t get selected
15:07 &lt;sdumitriu1> No
15:07 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> so they were told that it is better they work under GNU
15:07 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> and they would be given more slots for Octave under GNU
15:09 &lt;BogdanVancea> sdumitriu1, you said CCM could get more slots?
15:09 &lt;BogdanVancea> were you talking about the slots you can transfer?
15:09 &lt;BogdanVancea> or can Google award more slots?*
15:09 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Yes , he was talking about transfer
15:10 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> For google to award
15:10 &lt;sdumitriu1> 2 from transfer, but there's also a pool of slots that will be distributed to other organizations
15:10 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Org can apply for waiting list
15:11 &lt;sdumitriu1> I wonder where to do that...
15:12 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> ping carols on #gsoc
15:12 &lt;sdumitriu1> OK, I found the instructions
