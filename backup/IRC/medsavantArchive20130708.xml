13:44 &lt;bvancea> I got 10/10
13:44 &lt;bvancea> :)
13:44 &lt;bvancea> the weekend was sort of chaotic
13:45 &lt;bvancea> the advisors gave me some money to re-deploy the app on the cloud
13:45 &lt;bvancea> to show at the practical presentation
13:45 &lt;bvancea> the comitee teachers were not that interested, the barely managed to see it
13:46 &lt;bvancea> nah, I went out with my gf
13:46 &lt;bvancea> she had her exam today as well
13:46 &lt;sdumitriu1> Congratulations!

13:49 &lt;sdumitriu1> How did she do?
13:49 &lt;bvancea> she got a 10/10 aswell
13:50 &lt;sdumitriu1> Excellent
13:50 &lt;bvancea> yup :)
13:51 &lt;sdumitriu1> I'm wondering what happened to Miro
13:52 &lt;bvancea> he didn't get in the IRC ?
13:52 &lt;bvancea> these last few days?
13:53 &lt;sdumitriu1> Not since the last hangout
13:53 &lt;bvancea> hmmm
13:54 &lt;bvancea> did anyone try to send him an email or something?
13:54 &lt;sdumitriu1> I asked Marc to send him an email last week
13:54 &lt;bvancea> I see
13:54 &lt;bvancea> I suppose he didn't answer
13:59 &lt;bvancea> is it common for gsoc students to "fall of the grid" like that?
13:59 &lt;sdumitriu1> No, not really
14:00 &lt;bvancea> oh, I see
14:00 &lt;sdumitriu1> It happens, for a few days, but they should at least send an email saying that they have some problem
14:00 &lt;sdumitriu1> I'll send him an email
14:01 &lt;bvancea> well, maybe something did actually happen
14:32 &lt;sdumitriu1> A few weeks ago we had the same problem with another student
14:32 &lt;sdumitriu1> Turned out he was stranded by floods
15:04 &lt;bvancea> oh, I see
15:30 &lt;sdumitriu1> OK, so Miro is sick
15:31 &lt;bvancea> yup, seem so
