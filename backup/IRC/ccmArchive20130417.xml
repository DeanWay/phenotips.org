17:11 &lt;camelia_> Hello, I worked the http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/WritingComponents basic tutorial of writing XWiki components
17:11 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hi camelia_
17:12 &lt;camelia_> I know it is a basic hello world component, but I was wondering how to deploy it from the Phenotips admin account
17:13 &lt;camelia_> I selected the Wiki administration option from the drop-down list
17:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> Not from the wiki, you must put it on the filesystem
17:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> As it says on http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/WritingComponents#HDeployingtheComponent
17:14 &lt;sdumitriu1> The right path is in webapps/phenotips/WEB-INF/lib
17:14 &lt;sdumitriu1> Then you have to restart PhenoTips
17:15 &lt;camelia_> I thought it would be like an add extention... I try it as You suggested then, Thank You!
17:15 &lt;sdumitriu1> You're welcome

19:00 &lt;camelia_> So far I managed to install the hello world component and have it displayed along with the other 401 core extentions in the administrative pane
19:02 &lt;camelia_> now, before finishing for today, i'll try to make a new wiki page  for the component in the space
19:03 &lt;camelia_> as suggested in the line:  For example to access it in Velocity you'd write: $services.hello.greet().
19:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> The problem is that we've hidden the buttons for editing normal documents
19:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> So you'll have to manipulate the URL
19:14 &lt;sdumitriu1> Change the URL to a new document name, like http://localhost:8080/bin/TestingComponent
19:14 &lt;camelia_> That was what I was looking for. In http://www.theserverside.com/news/1363830/XWiki-A-Platform-for-Collaborative-Apps it said to switch to advanced edit mode but that's not available either in the profile
19:15 &lt;sdumitriu1> Then you'll get a message box with a link to the editor
19:16 &lt;sdumitriu1> It's not nice, we have to add user roles so that developers get back access to the editing menu
19:16 &lt;camelia_> I got to the editor, Thank You!
19:18 &lt;sdumitriu1> I'll be back in a few minutes
19:36 &lt;sdumitriu> Back
19:42 &lt;camelia_> I managed! http://picpaste.com/HelloWorld-xc16RG7A.png
19:43 &lt;sdumitriu> Excellent!
19:44 &lt;camelia_> I'll leave for tonight. Thank You for Your helpful advice and see You tomorrow!
19:45 &lt;sdumitriu> See you
