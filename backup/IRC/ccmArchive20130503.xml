09:42 &lt;froggy> While I can understand interfacing rest apis , web services but why does a disease management app need to interface external biometric devices?

11:22 &lt;froggy> and presentation
11:23 &lt;froggy> and say for diabetes , i take a note in the app that i eat a cookie today in afternoon . like bantapp. so is there a chart etc or something to map the cookie etc to a data figure say 150 cal mp/ltr ?
11:25 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes, in this case there should be a timeline plot with the sugar levels, and user's events placed on top of it
11:28 &lt;froggy> see i take a note that i eat a cookie and other things . at the end of the day I have to see how much cal i took in the day . now the app will have to map the number of cookies to calories . It wil be an appx estimation

11:36 &lt;mfiume> what's up froggy?
11:36 &lt;froggy> hey .. nicee ! Just wanted some info regarding the chronic disease manage ment app
11:37 &lt;mfiume> what about? it's intended to be a very open-ended project
11:37 &lt;mfiume> so we're expecting applicants to have a rough concept of the architecture that will be required
11:38 &lt;mfiume> you can use bantapp.com as a template
11:38 &lt;mfiume> or safeheart.ca
11:38 &lt;froggy> yes I went through the app's features ..
11:38 &lt;froggy> bantapp ie
11:40 &lt;froggy> so in the project template what do i put in the project architecture basicaly
11:40 &lt;froggy> ie proposal template
11:44 &lt;froggy> mfiume : ping
11:45 &lt;froggy> how do i define the project architecture . Will i state how the data//control will flow through my proposed app or its features etc
11:47 &lt;mfiume> assume you have an external device, a mobile app, and a remote backend (with a db and web server)
11:47 &lt;mfiume> explain the coordination of data and functions each serves
11:47 &lt;froggy> ok nice
11:53 &lt;froggy> a diagram will suffice
11:53 &lt;mfiume> sure
11:53 &lt;froggy> or a mockup
11:53 &lt;mfiume> either
11:53 &lt;mfiume> but be sure to describe the functionalities
11:54 &lt;mfiume> and what technologies will be required
11:54 &lt;froggy&gt; yes . ok thanks
