08:04 &lt;bvancea> hey sdumitriu
08:05 &lt;bvancea> feeling less tired after the weekened?
08:49 &lt;sdumitriu> has joined #medsavant
10:05 &lt;bvancea> has joined #medsavant
10:18 &lt;sdumitriu> Hello bvancea
10:18 &lt;sdumitriu> It's still weekend here
10:18 &lt;bvancea> hey
10:18 &lt;sdumitriu> Today is the Canada national day
10:18 &lt;bvancea> how come?
10:18 &lt;bvancea> oooohh
10:18 &lt;bvancea> I see
10:18 &lt;bvancea> nice
10:19 &lt;bvancea> any celebrations?
10:19 &lt;sdumitriu> Me? No
10:19 &lt;sdumitriu> But yes, there are a lot of activities in the city
10:20 &lt;bvancea> hehe
10:20 &lt;bvancea> well, you can enjoy the extended weekend
10:22 &lt;bvancea> anyway, I want to work on the JQPL to Solr query translator this week
10:22 &lt;sdumitriu> When did you say you're presenting your thesis?
10:22 &lt;bvancea> hmm
10:22 &lt;bvancea> next monday I think
10:22 &lt;sdumitriu> OK
10:23 &lt;bvancea> it one day in the interval 8-10 july, but they wont announce until sunday
10:25 &lt;bvancea> I think the cleanest way would be something similar to the xwiki xwql translator
10:25 &lt;bvancea> with sablecc
10:26 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
10:26 &lt;bvancea> sweet
10:27 &lt;bvancea> Its been some time since I've worked with lex/yacc, I'm a little excited
10:28 &lt;bvancea> hmm... I was wondering if we should create separate modules for the solr backend, ice backend classes
10:28 &lt;bvancea> maven modules that is
10:29 &lt;bvancea> maybe even a separate module for the jpql abstractions
10:30 &lt;sdumitriu> This has to be voted
10:31 &lt;bvancea> nice
10:31 &lt;bvancea> can I start the vote?
10:32 &lt;sdumitriu> Sure
10:32 &lt;sdumitriu> You should
10:33 &lt;bvancea> okay
10:33 &lt;sdumitriu> Send me a draft before, though
10:33 &lt;bvancea> sure
10:33 &lt;bvancea> how do you feel about the idea though?
10:33 &lt;sdumitriu> The idea is to start splitting the large modules into smaller ones
10:33 &lt;sdumitriu> So instead of one client and one server modules, we'd have smaller modules with one purpose only
10:35 &lt;bvancea> yes
10:35 &lt;bvancea> that would be pretty hard to do in one go though
10:36 &lt;bvancea> so we could do it one module at a time
10:36 &lt;bvancea> and since there hasn't been a lot of work done on the backends, now would be the best time to do it
10:41 &lt;sdumitriu> Indeed
10:55 &lt;bvancea> okay, send you the first draft
10:55 &lt;bvancea> sent*
10:57 &lt;sdumitriu> Will read it shortly
10:58 &lt;bvancea> ok
11:47 &lt;sdumitriu> bvancea: The mail looks good
11:47 &lt;sdumitriu> You can send it
11:48 &lt;bvancea> kay
11:50 &lt;bvancea> I'll be afk for about 40-50 minutes, need to help my brother with some luggage to the train station
11:50 &lt;bvancea> he's moving out of the dorms today ;))
13:15 &lt;bvancea> has joined #medsavant
13:21 &lt;sdumitriu> Welcome back bvancea
13:21 &lt;bvancea> hey
13:21 &lt;bvancea> thanks
13:24 &lt;bvancea> did you manage to read Brian's response to my status email?
13:25 &lt;bvancea> I didn't give facets to much though from the JPQL perspective
13:26 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes, will answer soon
13:26 &lt;bvancea> but aren't they somewhat equivalent to SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TABLE, group by COLUMN
13:26 &lt;sdumitriu> Kind of
13:27 &lt;bvancea&gt; I trying to think of cases when that isn't holding
13:27 &lt;sdumitriu> You'd have to execute each such query individually, while Solr already provides the result for all the facets
13:27 &lt;sdumitriu> Don't worry
13:28 &lt;bvancea> okay
13:29 &lt;bvancea> I'll get back to browsing the XWiki query parser code
13:29 &lt;bvancea> :)</content>
