16:24 &lt;akats> sdumitriu: I think I fixed it, but it's a hack
16:24 &lt;sdumitriu> How?
16:25 &lt;shalinshah1993> has quit
16:26 &lt;akats> I'm not certain, but the problem appears to be that the context has no document set, because I'm running the REST server. So what I did is get the current context through execution, and setDoc() to DocumentReference("xwiki", "Main", "WebHome")
16:26 &lt;sdumitriu> Oh, you're running through rest
16:26 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes, that's normal
16:27 &lt;akats> Ahaha xwiki normal that is
16:27 &lt;sdumitriu> Were the two requests on different servers?
16:28 &lt;sdumitriu> It's not a bug, it's a feature!"
16:28 &lt;akats> Well same server, just talking to itself
16:29 &lt;akats> Is there a proper way of doing what I did?

17:12 &lt;akats> When the results come back, (to the user on Phenotips who made a request) how should they be displayed?
17:12 &lt;akats> as in, should it be just pretty text?
17:12 &lt;akats> or should a "fake" patient be created?
