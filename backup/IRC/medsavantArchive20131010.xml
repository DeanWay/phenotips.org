12:45 &lt;mfiume> hey jim
12:45 &lt;mfiume> saw your email
12:45 &lt;Jim^^> hi
12:45 &lt;mfiume> working remotely today
12:45 &lt;Jim^^> ok
12:46 &lt;Jim^^> It looks like annovar uses a very minimal representation for variants
12:46 &lt;mfiume> i didnt quite get this
12:46 &lt;mfiume> "variants uploaded to medsavant can contain surrounding context that affects their position"
12:46 &lt;mfiume> for snps the position is pretty fixed
12:46 &lt;mfiume> no?
12:46 &lt;Jim^^> Well in medsavant, at least with the vcf I have, A variant might be represented like this:
12:46 &lt;Jim^^> Pos Ref Alt Type
12:46 &lt;Jim^^> 63,735 CCTACTA CCTA
12:47 &lt;Jim^^> that would be a deletion
12:47 &lt;Jim^^> whereas in annovar it would be like this:
12:47 &lt;Jim^^> Pos Ref Alt
12:47 &lt;Jim^^> 63,739 CTA 3
12:47 &lt;Jim^^> The first one has surrounding context -- i.e. padding sequence
12:48 &lt;Jim^^> there's similar issues with insertions
12:48 &lt;mfiume> ok so we don't officially support annotation of insertions or deletions
12:48 &lt;mfiume> because of this reason
12:48 &lt;Jim^^> Ah
12:48 &lt;mfiume> its an issue with adherence to the vcf standard
12:48 &lt;Jim^^> Well it wouldn't be hard to fix though would it?  Just always represent variants internally using the minimal description
12:49 &lt;Jim^^> i.e. with surrounding context
12:49 &lt;Jim^^> no surrounding context i mean
12:49 &lt;mfiume> ya minimally, no surrounding context
12:49 &lt;mfiume> let's add that as 1.2 priority
12:49 &lt;Jim^^> OK
12:49 &lt;mfiume> it will boil down to doing 1 off conversions
12:50 &lt;mfiume> it may not be simple, bc there's no standard way to represent these really
12:50 &lt;mfiume> but if they're consistent in all the annovar files then we should at least support those
12:50 &lt;Jim^^> True, but annovar will always use a minimal format
12:50 &lt;Jim^^> it's not consistent in the annovar input, but annovar figures it out
12:51 &lt;mfiume> ya, k then it's worth doing at some point
12:51 &lt;Jim^^> Basically, annovar uses these rules
12:51 &lt;Jim^^> 1. If Ref==0, then the reference is not specified.
12:51 &lt;Jim^^> 4. If Ref is a nucleotide sequence and Alt is [0-9]+[A-Z]+, then it is an insertion and deletion (in-del).
12:51 &lt;Jim^^> Did that go through?  the phenotips_org just gave me a cryptic error
12:51 &lt;Jim^^> &lt;phenotips_org> Jim^^: An error occurred while executing Wiki IRC Bot Listener [xwiki:IRC.LoggingBotListener]. Check your server logs.
12:52 &lt;mfiume> i got 1-4
12:52 &lt;Jim^^> OK, good
12:52 &lt;mfiume> with errors after that
12:52 &lt;Jim^^> There's only the 4
12:53 &lt;mfiume> ya i think sometimes the position can be different for the same indel
12:53 &lt;mfiume> ex. pos 10 ref actact alt acta
12:54 &lt;mfiume> and pos 11 ref ctact alt ct
12:54 &lt;Jim^^> Can we treat in-dels as a separate insertion and deletion?
12:54 &lt;mfiume> does it handle position issues too?
12:54 &lt;Jim^^> i.e. as two rows?
12:54 &lt;Jim^^> well if we're ignoring insertions, deletions, and in-dels for 1.1, then are there still position issues?
12:54 &lt;mfiume> no an indel is one or the other
12:55 &lt;mfiume> not if we claim we don't officially support their annotation
12:55 &lt;mfiume> then whatever is given is shown in our interface
12:56 &lt;mfiume> if orion is around, ask him to explain more re: position issues, he was the one who showed me the problem
12:56 &lt;Jim^^> I understand how position issues result from insertions, deletions, and indels.
12:56 &lt;Jim^^> In my above example there was one
12:57 &lt;Jim^^> because of the sequence padding
12:57 &lt;mfiume> ya, exactly
12:57 &lt;Jim^^> so that will be something we can resolve for 1.2
12:57 &lt;mfiume> yup
12:58 &lt;Jim^^> OK, so I will need to rerun the annovar scripts I think.  Hopefully it will be faster since I'll be skipping insertions, deletions, and in-dels -- and I can try running on compressed filesystems
12:59 &lt;mfiume> why rerun?
12:59 &lt;mfiume> our annotator is programmed to skip indels
13:00 &lt;mfiume> btw do our "position" annotations include an end position?
13:00 &lt;Jim^^> there are some other problems in the input files - I'll see if I can fix them through a quick one off script, if not, I'll re-run.
13:01 &lt;Jim^^> no
13:01 &lt;Jim^^> I omit the end position if it's a position annotation
13:02 &lt;mfiume> are you working on -dev?
13:02 &lt;Jim^^> No I work locally
13:02 &lt;mfiume> ok i may start hammering it soon
13:03 &lt;Jim^^> ok
13:03 &lt;mfiume> importing 1000 genomes data
13:03 &lt;Jim^^> from the annovar files?
13:03 &lt;mfiume> also
13:03 &lt;mfiume> we have very good machines to run important jobs
13:03 &lt;mfiume> the "dupa"s
13:04 &lt;Jim^^> OK, that could help
13:04 &lt;Jim^^> I can parallelize this stuff easily enough, but as-is it's I/O bound
