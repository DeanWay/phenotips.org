13:31 &lt;qwebirc52220> hi there
13:32 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hi qwebirc52220
13:33 &lt;qwebirc52220> i would like to contribute to ccm under gsoc, but i can't decide which idea to choose
13:34 &lt;sdumitriu1> Well, what skills do you have, and what do you like doing
13:34 &lt;qwebirc52220> can u tell which ones are of higher priority to your organisation??
13:34 &lt;sdumitriu1> "Automatic layout for the pedigree editor" is very important
13:35 &lt;qwebirc52220> i m versed with data structures, algorithms and graph theory
13:35 &lt;sdumitriu1> "Expansion of the SafeHeart App" too
13:35 &lt;kushalk124> has joined #ccm
13:35 &lt;qwebirc52220> plus java, java-script,pyjton and c languages
13:38 &lt;qwebirc52220> sdmitriu1>> thank you sir for your reply.....
13:39 &lt;sdumitriu1> Look into the pedigree layout project then
13:39 &lt;kushalk124> has joined #ccm
13:39 &lt;sdumitriu1> It requires algorithms, graphs, and JavaScript
13:41 &lt;qwebirc52220> sir can you guide me to any documentation or any other source please......
13:42 &lt;qwebirc52220> from the description given i can't get a full understanding of what a pedigree editor does?
13:43 &lt;kushalk124> has joined #ccm
13:45 &lt;sdumitriu1> qwebirc52220: http://phenotips.org/edit/data/P0000004?sheet=PhenoTips.PedigreeEditor#
13:47 &lt;qwebirc52220> thank you sir, i am now studying this tool ...

13:52 &lt;kushalk124> has joined #ccm
13:56 &lt;kushalk124> has joined #ccm
13:59 &lt;qwebirc52220> sir, from what i observed , that when i click on a node, new node is not formed,  so is that what you mean by " interactively adjusting the layout to fit live updates to the pedigree." in the idea description??
13:59 &lt;qwebirc52220> and "build a new layout from scratch"...
14:01 &lt;kushalk124> has joined #ccm
14:02 &lt;sdumitriu1> New nodes are added
14:02 &lt;sdumitriu1> But not when you click on a node
14:02 &lt;qwebirc52220> @sdumitriu1 >> sir please reply
14:02 &lt;sdumitriu1> You have to click on the small dots
14:04 &lt;qwebirc52220> the small blue dots dont seem to work!
14:06 &lt;kushalk124> has joined #ccm
14:10 &lt;kushalk124> has joined #ccm
14:12 &lt;qwebirc52220> plus i think the layout needs redesign completely
14:12 &lt;qwebirc52220> one one male of one female cant have children......
14:13 &lt;qwebirc52220> each node needs to store two entries- one for husband , other for wife!
14:14 &lt;kushalk124> has joined #ccm

16:58 &lt;BFlavien> Hello everybody :)
16:58 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hi
16:58 &lt;BFlavien> I want to start by apologizing for my bad english skills, i'm french, but i hope being understandable
16:59 &lt;sdumitriu1> Don't worry
16:59 &lt;BFlavien> I'm a student who is very interested in the google summer of code
17:00 &lt;BFlavien> And some of your project really interested me, so here i come to chat
17:01 &lt;sdumitriu1> Very good
17:02 &lt;BFlavien> I'm strongly interested by the Mobile UI for the Pedigree tool and Mobile Web interface for PhenoTips projects (maybe more the Web than the Mobile)
17:03 &lt;sdumitriu1> They're both web and mobile
17:04 &lt;sdumitriu1> Meaning that we're looking for a web interface that works well on mobiles
17:04 &lt;sdumitriu1> Not a mobile native application
17:04 &lt;UCC> has joined #ccm
17:04 &lt;BFlavien> Yes, my bad, I mean i prefer  Mobile Web interface for PhenoTips projects than Mobile UI for the Pedigree tool but just a little bit
17:08 &lt;BFlavien> You wanted just a mobile web interface, or a "responsive" one working on every screen sizes?
17:08 &lt;sdumitriu1> Responsive
17:09 &lt;sdumitriu1> So the same URL should work well on any device
17:09 &lt;BFlavien> Yep media queries
17:10 &lt;BFlavien> Do you have a lot of student interrested by?
17:14 &lt;sdumitriu1> In this one, not many
17:16 &lt;BFlavien&gt; And could you tell me what student profile you want, in order to see if i can hope send you an application?
17:17 &lt;sdumitriu1> It's written in the details of every project
17:17 &lt;sdumitriu1> For https://gsoc.ccm.sickkids.ca/GoogleSummerOfCode/Mobile+Web+interface+for+PhenoTips it's:
17:17 &lt;sdumitriu1> Required skills: JavaScript + experience with any popular JS library, HTML, CSS.
17:17 &lt;sdumitriu1> Nice to have: Experience with mobile development, responsive design, jQuery Mobile.
17:19 &lt;BFlavien> Yes of course, I already read this, but for example, I already make some little things with JS, and JQuery, but i can't tell i've a lot of "experience"
17:20 &lt;BFlavien> Then if you tell me you just need an very experienced JS programmer, I fear to be not as good as required
17:22 &lt;sdumitriu1> There is some JS required, but I don't think you need to be an expert for this one
17:22 &lt;sdumitriu1> You will have to adapt a few widgets to work a bit differently on a smaller screen
17:23 &lt;sdumitriu1> The Pedigree project is a bit harder on this aspect, since it's mostly JS code
17:24 &lt;BFlavien> Is there a way to see an image or the page the project want to adapt ?
17:25 &lt;sdumitriu1> phenotips.org
17:25 &lt;sdumitriu1> Click on Demo
17:26 &lt;BFlavien> Thank you !
17:30 &lt;BFlavien> I've a strange question, but what must a student do in order to convince you to be the one you want?
17:30 &lt;sdumitriu1> Be active on IRC, try to get a few pull request done, and have a decent GSoC application
17:32 &lt;BFlavien> May i ask you what you mean by a decent GSoC application?
17:33 &lt;sdumitriu1> Well, we have the template that you're supposed to use
17:34 &lt;sdumitriu1> Every question should have a good answer
17:35 &lt;sdumitriu1> The ones that need more details are the architecture and timeline
17:35 &lt;sdumitriu1> So we want to see that you did come up with a serious plan for the project
17:36 &lt;BFlavien> Yes I understand
17:36 &lt;sdumitriu1> I have to go, I'll be back in a few minutes
17:41 &lt;sdumitriu1> has joined #ccm
17:46 &lt;camelia_> has joined #ccm
17:51 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hey camelia_
17:52 &lt;BFlavien> I've a new question, I'm looking the bucktrackr, and I want to ask you if there is a ticket in particular, as your point of view, which could be a good way to you for testing me ?
17:52 &lt;sdumitriu1> Well, most of the easy issue have just been fixed
17:52 &lt;sdumitriu1> We'll post new ones soon
17:53 &lt;BFlavien> I'm really sorry for asking you this kind of question, but it's the first time I looking for contributing in a big sized project
17:53 &lt;sdumitriu1> Don't worry
17:54 &lt;BFlavien> It's just I don't want to disappoint you by not doing what you expect
18:01 &lt;sdumitriu1> Leaving again, back in 15
18:01 &lt;BFlavien> Ok :)
18:27 &lt;sdumitriu> Back
18:29 &lt;BFlavien> I just have a little question, Have you already a mockup, or things like that for the mobile version?
18:30 &lt;sdumitriu> Marta was working on that
18:31 &lt;BFlavien> Ok
18:37 &lt;BFlavien> I will not annoy you any longer, I will try to enter in the code, and trying to help if I can by resolving some things in the bugtracker
18:38 &lt;BFlavien> Thank you very much for your patience and your kindness with me
18:38 &lt;BFlavien> And I apologize again, and never enough, for reading my bad English sentences
