11:53 &lt;camelia_> Hello, my name is Camelia and I'm interested in contributing to PhenoTips with the project: Visualization and analysis of patient data for the diagnosis of genetic disorders
11:53 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi camelia_
11:54 &lt;camelia_> Last Friday I downloaded the source code and tried to build it according to the instructions. The build was successful overall (with some warnings along the way).
11:54 &lt;sdumitriu> I was going to write to you today
11:54 &lt;camelia_> Thank You!
11:55 &lt;sdumitriu> Sorry, but last week was very busy
11:55 &lt;camelia_> I ran the build procedure once again and redirected the output to file so that I can send You the messages, if You agree
11:56 &lt;sdumitriu> You can pastebin the output, that's easier
11:56 &lt;sdumitriu> pastebin.com
11:59 &lt;camelia_> http://pastebin.com/tpVk21UQ
12:00 &lt;sdumitriu> I think the problem might be duplicated jars...
12:00 &lt;sdumitriu> Which jvm are you using?
12:01 &lt;camelia_> java version "1.7.0_03" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_03-b05) Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 22.1-b02, mixed mode, sharing)
12:01 &lt;p1f> has joined #ccm
12:01 &lt;sdumitriu> Hey p1f
12:02 &lt;p1f> hi!
12:02 &lt;sdumitriu> Were you complaining about classpath errors too?
12:02 &lt;p1f> yeap)
12:02 &lt;sdumitriu> Good, just investigating that with camelia_
12:02 &lt;p1f> still without any improvements..
12:03 &lt;p1f> Which configuration do you use for development? ./standalone or smth different?
12:04 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes, standalone
12:04 &lt;sdumitriu> It's the easiest
12:05 &lt;sdumitriu> But for production I usually end up with tomcat/mysql with a httpd/mod_proxy_ajp in front
12:08 &lt;camelia_> Other than the build, that eventually will succeed, I would like to ask You some questions in order to understand better the projectsome
12:09 &lt;p1f> What is strange, Jetty reports: No JSP Support for /, did not find org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet
12:09 &lt;sdumitriu> Try this:
12:09 &lt;sdumitriu> From distribution/standalone/target/phenotips-*/webapps/phenotips/WEB-INF/lib remove:
12:09 &lt;sdumitriu> guava-12.0.jar
12:09 &lt;sdumitriu> plexus-utils-2.0.6.jar
12:09 &lt;sdumitriu> rome-0.9.jar
12:09 &lt;sdumitriu> woodstox-core-asl-4.1.1.jar
12:09 &lt;sdumitriu> asm-4.1.jar
12:09 &lt;sdumitriu> p1f: That's normal, we don't need JSP, but the log is hard to remove
12:10 &lt;sdumitriu> camelia_: The build warnings are OK, there's nothing we can do about velocity-tools, it's an older release done before they switched to Maven
12:11 &lt;sdumitriu> It's harmless
12:11 &lt;sdumitriu> After you removed those jars, does it work?
12:12 &lt;p1f> ok, but doesn't it affect ./solr -- Solr Admin? seems like it requires Servlets..
12:12 &lt;p1f> or you just don't use it?)))
12:12 &lt;sdumitriu> Solr also doesn't require JSP
12:12 &lt;camelia_> i'm trying Your advice and I'll tell You the result in a couple of minutes
12:12 &lt;sdumitriu> Servlets are different, they're the only thing that a webapp really needs
12:13 &lt;sdumitriu> Also, can you check if you have WEB-INF/lib/emory-util-classloader-2.1.jar
12:15 &lt;p1f> I do have one here: ./webapps/phenotips/WEB-INF/lib/emory-util-classloader-2.1.jar
12:23 &lt;p1f> Do you get the same "Failed to execute the [velocity] macro": java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/xwiki/classloader/URIClassLoader$URIResourceFinder exceptions?
12:24 &lt;sdumitriu> I don't
12:24 &lt;sdumitriu> It's always working for me
12:24 &lt;sdumitriu> p1f: What version of Java are you using?
12:24 &lt;sdumitriu> java -version
12:25 &lt;p1f> java version "1.7.0_17"
12:25 &lt;p1f> linux mint 11
12:25 &lt;p1f> tried also on ubuntu 11.10
12:25 &lt;sdumitriu> I have the same
12:26 &lt;p1f> with the same oracle jdk
12:26 &lt;sdumitriu> mvn -version
12:26 &lt;p1f> 3.0.3
12:26 &lt;sdumitriu> I have 3.0.4
12:26 &lt;p1f> it failed building with mvn yesterday, so I installed mvn3
12:27 &lt;sdumitriu> pastebin the output of:
12:27 &lt;sdumitriu> ls -1 webapps/phenotips/WEB-INF/lib
12:29 &lt;p1f> pastebin.com/VWKEH9bM
12:29 &lt;p1f> I removed the files you mentioned above
12:31 &lt;p1f> I'll be AFK for 1.5hour
12:33 &lt;sdumitriu> Aha, found it
12:34 &lt;sdumitriu> It seems that your emory-utils-classloader-2.1.jar is different than mine
12:39 &lt;sdumitriu> camelia_, p1f: rm ~/.m2/repository/edu/emory/mathcs/util/emory-util-classloader/2.1/emory-util-classloader-2.1.jar
12:39 &lt;sdumitriu> Then mvn clean install everything
12:39 &lt;sdumitriu> It should fix the problem
12:39 &lt;camelia_> I still get the velocity related error.  You said that it might be the emory-util-classloader-2.1.jar the cause?
12:39 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
12:40 &lt;camelia_> ok I'll start it all over again the mvn clean install and tell You the result
12:41 &lt;sdumitriu> Don't forget to rm that broken file
12:49 &lt;sdumitriu> I'll be back in 15 minutes

14:17 &lt;p1f> Woohooo!
14:18 &lt;p1f> i rm'd the library
14:18 &lt;p1f> mvn3 clean &amp;&amp; mvn3 install
14:18 &lt;p1f> now it's loaded
14:18 &lt;sdumitriu1> p1f: Perfect, thanks for the help nailing this down
14:19 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> has joined #ccm
14:22 &lt;p1f> Can I somehow populate the DB automatically?
14:22 &lt;sdumitriu1> With random patients?
14:23 &lt;sdumitriu1> I had a script for that, but unfortunately I didn't save it anywhere... I'll have to redo it
14:25 &lt;p1f> Yes) well, I can do that myself via UI macroses
14:25 &lt;p1f> Just thought, that could be a great idea to have "Populate with demo data" button)
14:25 &lt;ravigarg27> has joined #ccm
14:25 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yeah. but not in production

16:00 &lt;camelia_> I'm still trying to make it work.One thing I observed is that the only POM to be downloaded during build is that for velocity tools
16:01 &lt;camelia_> Downloading: http://nexus.cs.toronto.edu/nexus/content/repositories/releases/velocity-tools/velocity-tools/1.4/velocity-tools-1.4.pom

16:08 &lt;camelia1> ok, I deleted it
16:08 &lt;sdumitriu1> Now build again
