15:15 &lt;aw1231> Hi GSOC-Dushyant___
15:15 &lt;GSOC-Dushyant___> hello alan
15:16 &lt;aw1231> You are applying for GSOC I assume?
15:16 &lt;GSOC-Dushyant___> yes
15:16 &lt;aw1231> What project? Or are you doing one of your own?
15:17 &lt;GSOC-Dushyant___> I was interested in two projects : 1 is UI for a mobile web app and the other is machine learning methods for modelling
15:24 &lt;GSOC-Dushyant___> Alan your introduction ?
15:26 &lt;aw1231> Cool.  I'm most likely going to apply for the one related to medical ontologies.
15:26 &lt;aw1231> I'm a student too.
15:27 &lt;GSOC-Dushyant___> hmmm cool
15:28 &lt;aw1231> :) Good luck!
15:28 &lt;sdumitriu> Hey, don't forget that the student application period just started
15:28 &lt;sdumitriu> "Don't delay, submit today!"
15:29 &lt;aw1231> Will do!
15:29 &lt;GSOC-Dushyant___> yes
15:30 &lt;sdumitriu> The sooner you submit, the more constructive feedback the mentors can give you
15:31 &lt;sdumitriu> And your application will be easier to remember than the dozens we get at the last moment
15:36 &lt;GSOC-Dushyant___> i see
15:36 &lt;GSOC-Dushyant___> thanks for the information

15:50 &lt;GSOC-Dushyant___> Hello
15:50 &lt;sdumitriu> is now known as &lt;sdumitriu_[Away]&gt;
15:50 &lt;GSOC-Dushyant___> i was getting this error while installing maven
15:50 &lt;sdumitriu_[Away]&gt; is now known as &lt;sdumitriu>
15:50 &lt;GSOC-Dushyant___> its giving me an error could not find tools.jar when its actualy there in the lib folder
15:51 &lt;sdumitriu> GSOC-Dushyant___: Check that you have M2_HOME defined
15:51 &lt;sdumitriu> And that Java is properly installed
15:51 &lt;sdumitriu> What does "mvn -version" say?
15:51 &lt;GSOC-Dushyant___> yes its installed
15:52 &lt;GSOC-Dushyant___> Apache Maven 3.0.5 (r01de14724cdef164cd33c7c8c2fe155faf9602da; 2013-02-19 19:21:28+0530) Maven home: C:\Program Files\apache-maven-3.0.5 Java version: 1.7.0_51, vendor: Oracle Corporation Java home: C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7 Default locale: en_IN, platform encoding: Cp1252 OS name: "windows 7", version: "6.1", arch: "x86", family: "windows" C:\Users\admin\My Documents\GitHub\phenotips>
15:53 &lt;GSOC-Dushyant___> this path " C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7/../lib/tools.jar" which the maven is generating does not seem to be proper
15:53 &lt;GSOC-Dushyant___> the slashes do not seem to be in the right format
15:54 &lt;sdumitriu> That should be fine, Java can handle both kinds of slashes
15:55 &lt;sdumitriu> Sorry, but I have to go now, try to ask for help in #maven
15:55 &lt;sdumitriu> is now known as &lt;sdumitriu_[Away]&gt;

20:39 &lt;aw1231> *sdumitriu
20:43 &lt;sdumitriu> aw1231: Several things
20:43 &lt;sdumitriu> - keep exploring PhenoTips, try to understand it better
20:44 &lt;sdumitriu> - wait for feedback
20:44 &lt;sdumitriu> - improve the application (you can edit it until the submission deadline)
20:44 &lt;sdumitriu> - try to fix some bugs
20:47 &lt;aw1231> I'm nervous to submit a bugfix, mostly because I don't know whether it will be acceptable.
20:48 &lt;sdumitriu> Well, that's part of your training
20:48 &lt;aw1231> :) alright
20:51 &lt;sdumitriu> aw1231: Looking at your application, make sure you can provide Google with proof of enrollment; to be eligible, you must be considered a student on April 21
20:51 &lt;sdumitriu> http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2014/proofofenrollment
