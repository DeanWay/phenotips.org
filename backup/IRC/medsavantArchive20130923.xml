12:33 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hey bvancea
12:33 &lt;sdumitriu1> How's it going?
12:35 &lt;bvancea> hey sdumitriu1
12:35 &lt;bvancea> good, I'm finishing my final report
12:35 &lt;bvancea> planning to send it with the status
12:37 &lt;bvancea> I still have some bugs in the code, not sure what to do about them :(
12:37 &lt;bvancea> if the development should stop today
12:40 &lt;bvancea> and you?
12:41 &lt;sdumitriu1> On the final stretch for the PhenoTips release...
12:41 &lt;sdumitriu1> Well, the development for what's being evaluated stops today
12:41 &lt;sdumitriu1> You can always continue fixing things
12:44 &lt;bvancea> I understand
12:45 &lt;sdumitriu1> Did you go around, visiting the neighborhood?
12:45 &lt;bvancea> so I should stop committing until the final evaluation?
12:45 &lt;bvancea> a bit
12:45 &lt;sdumitriu1> No
12:45 &lt;bvancea> I split my time between going to classes and fixing stuff for the final evaluation
12:46 &lt;bvancea> my gf is not very pleased
12:46 &lt;bvancea> ;))
12:46 &lt;sdumitriu1> But the code that you're going to submit to Google should only include commits up to today
12:46 &lt;bvancea> oh, I understand
12:46 &lt;bvancea> regarding that code
12:46 &lt;bvancea> what code should I send?
12:46 &lt;bvancea> the whole Medsavant ?
12:46 &lt;bvancea> with the client + server + dists
12:46 &lt;sdumitriu1> No...
12:47 &lt;sdumitriu1> With git, you could send all your commits
12:47 &lt;bvancea> hmm
12:47 &lt;bvancea> as a patch somehow?
12:47 &lt;sdumitriu1> Google doesn't actually care, it just has to have something in case they get a tax control and they have to prove that they gave you money for something and they're not just laundering
12:47 &lt;bvancea> oh
12:47 &lt;bvancea> I see
12:48 &lt;bvancea> well, can I select all commits made by me from my feature branch?
12:48 &lt;bvancea> I've merged master into my branch a couple of times
12:49 &lt;bvancea> so other commits are there as well
12:49 &lt;sdumitriu1> git log -p --author=vancea
12:49 &lt;bvancea> nice
12:51 &lt;bvancea> so now that I've selected the commits, how should I store them?
12:51 &lt;bvancea> to upload?
12:52 &lt;sdumitriu1> Put them in a .patch file
12:52 &lt;sdumitriu1> git log -p --author=vancea > bogdan_vancea__medsavant__gsoc13.patch
12:52 &lt;bvancea> and them upload that?
12:52 &lt;sdumitriu1> gzip it, then upload
12:52 &lt;bvancea> I see, thanks
12:56 &lt;bvancea> so after I'm done with the work on my feature branch, can I keep contributing to medsavant on other issues?
12:57 &lt;sdumitriu1> Sure
12:57 &lt;sdumitriu1> One of the goals of GSoC is to attract permanent contributors to open source projects
12:57 &lt;sdumitriu1> If you liked MedSavant and you want to continue to contribute, then that's a bigger success
12:59 &lt;sdumitriu1> And of course we'll be happy to have you around
13:00 &lt;bvancea> well, I've seen a lot of new issues popping up
13:00 &lt;bvancea> and I'm curious about them
13:01 &lt;bvancea> I would like to continue contributing if I have time to spare from Uni
13:05 &lt;bvancea> is there a hangout this week?
13:06 &lt;sdumitriu1> There should be
13:06 &lt;sdumitriu1> Nobody scheduled it yet, right?
13:07 &lt;bvancea> yep, not scheduled
13:07 &lt;bvancea> I can do a doodle if you want
13:07 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yep, that would be great
13:27 &lt;bvancea> I've reated
13:27 &lt;bvancea> I've created the poll
