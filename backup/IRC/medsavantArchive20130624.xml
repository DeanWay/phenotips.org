05:06 &lt;mcupak> has joined #medsavant
05:08 &lt;bvancea> hey mcupak
05:08 &lt;bvancea> what's up
05:08 &lt;bvancea> ?
05:09 &lt;mcupak> bvancea: hey, how was it going?
05:10 &lt;bvancea> pretty good, playing around, indexing some data
05:10 &lt;bvancea> you?
05:12 &lt;mcupak> good
05:12 &lt;mcupak> trying to run some experiments with sharding
05:12 &lt;mcupak> hopefully with some good performance results
05:13 &lt;bvancea> did you manage to shard infobright?
05:13 &lt;bvancea> niceee
05:15 &lt;mcupak> that would be the whole project, sort of :D
05:15 &lt;mcupak> just working with some fixed data sets for now
05:17 &lt;bvancea> oh
05:17 &lt;bvancea> but you're running more instances of infobright?
05:17 &lt;bvancea> ;))
05:21 &lt;mcupak> actually not atm, but that is the goal
05:21 &lt;bvancea> I'm really curious how hard sharding an inforbirght instance
05:21 &lt;bvancea> since most people don't like sharding mysql
05:21 &lt;bvancea> except facebook
05:21 &lt;bvancea> :))
05:22 &lt;mcupak> well medsavant has a pretty limited set of queries it runs, that should make things a lot simpler
05:23 &lt;bvancea> could be
05:24 &lt;bvancea> and there aren't any join on the variant search
05:24 &lt;bvancea> which is nice
05:25 &lt;mcupak> yeah
05:25 &lt;mcupak> hopefully I'll have more time to look into it now, I've been pretty busy with school lately
05:26 &lt;mcupak> I'm sure you know what I mean ;)
05:26 &lt;bvancea> hehe
05:26 &lt;bvancea> yeah
05:26 &lt;bvancea> you're in the final year aswell?
05:26 &lt;mcupak> I'll be finishing next year
05:27 &lt;bvancea> ah, I see
05:27 &lt;bvancea> and you're in the middle of the examination session?
05:28 &lt;mcupak> I'm done with the exams now, just had to finish a project
05:31 &lt;bvancea> ah, I see
05:31 &lt;bvancea> nice
05:32 &lt;mcupak> are you done with your exams?
05:32 &lt;bvancea> yup, finished last week
08:51 &lt;bvancea> has joined #medsavant
09:04 &lt;sdumitriu> has joined #medsavant
09:19 &lt;bvancea> hey sdumitriu, you on?
09:19 &lt;sdumitriu> Hey bvancea
09:19 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
09:19 &lt;bvancea> oh lol, I was waiting for sdumitriu1 to get on :))
09:21 &lt;bvancea> I'm writing my status and I trying to dedice on what to focus this week
09:22 &lt;bvancea> should I try to integrate the variant core into medsavant? or create new cores for other entities, like chromoses
09:26 &lt;sdumitriu> Let's start the integration
09:28 &lt;bvancea> nice
09:28 &lt;bvancea> :D
09:29 &lt;bvancea> so I've managed to finish a simple java class that builds a query from normal terms and filter terms and gets a response from Solr
09:29 &lt;bvancea> for performance testing
09:30 &lt;bvancea> now I just need to think of some tests that will simulate normal user interaction
09:38 &lt;bvancea> I'll start by just adding longer queries
11:41 &lt;bvancea> has joined #medsavant
11:41 &lt;bvancea> I keep disconnecting :|
13:06 &lt;sdumitriu1> has joined #medsavant
16:58 &lt;bvancea> has joined #medsavant
16:58 &lt;bvancea> has joined #medsavant
16:58 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hey bvancea
16:58 &lt;bvancea> hey sdumitru1
16:58 &lt;sdumitriu1> Still disconnecting?
16:59 &lt;bvancea> should be fine now
16:59 &lt;bvancea> :)
17:00 &lt;bvancea> my love-hate relationship with the campus internet is going towards away from the love
17:00 &lt;bvancea> anyway, you mentioned a call with mcupak
17:01 &lt;bvancea> on the response email for the status
17:01 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
17:01 &lt;sdumitriu1> Well, not now
17:01 &lt;sdumitriu1> We need to schedule it first
17:02 &lt;bvancea> well yeah
17:02 &lt;sdumitriu1> At the latest, it could be at the common hangout next week
17:02 &lt;bvancea> hmmm
17:02 &lt;bvancea> I would prefer it this week
17:02 &lt;sdumitriu1> OK
17:02 &lt;bvancea> the sooner the better imo
17:03 &lt;bvancea> I guess Miro will also participate
17:03 &lt;sdumitriu1> And Marc
17:03 &lt;bvancea> and marc
17:03 &lt;bvancea> yes
17:05 &lt;bvancea> so when would be a good date for that?
17:05 &lt;sdumitriu1> I'm mostly free
17:06 &lt;sdumitriu1> Send a reply asking for a date from the others
17:06 &lt;sdumitriu1> We could Doodle it
17:06 &lt;bvancea> Doodle it?
17:06 &lt;bvancea> :))
17:06 &lt;sdumitriu1> http://doodle.com/
17:06 &lt;bvancea> wow
17:06 &lt;bvancea> nice
17:07 &lt;sdumitriu1> It's good for finding a common time
17:07 &lt;bvancea> hehe
17:07 &lt;bvancea> cool
17:07 &lt;bvancea> did you start one?
17:08 &lt;bvancea> with Doodle, I mean
17:08 &lt;bvancea> or can I do it?
17:10 &lt;sdumitriu1> You can do it
17:10 &lt;bvancea> nice, commit rights
17:11 &lt;bvancea> thanks
17:12 &lt;bvancea> Doodle looks really nice
17:12 &lt;bvancea> hmmm
17:12 &lt;bvancea> so if I choose a timezone in Doodle, when you see the event
17:13 &lt;bvancea> do you see time corresponding to your timezone?
17:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
17:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> I think so
17:14 &lt;bvancea> hmm
17:14 &lt;bvancea> ok
17:17 &lt;bvancea> somehow I managed to finish it without inviting anyone
17:17 &lt;bvancea> http://doodle.com/e49wse69ubd3c5wg
17:17 &lt;bvancea> is it ok?
17:18 &lt;bvancea> what time do you see?
17:18 &lt;sdumitriu1> That's a broad time range...
17:18 &lt;sdumitriu1> 11-5
17:18 &lt;bvancea> hmmm
17:18 &lt;bvancea> thats ok
17:18 &lt;sdumitriu1> 11AM-5AM
17:19 &lt;sdumitriu1> I don't think anybody wants to do this at 3AM...
17:19 &lt;bvancea> should I set lower intervals
17:19 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
17:19 &lt;bvancea> okay
17:19 &lt;sdumitriu1> Make 2 intervals per day
17:20 &lt;bvancea> so when are the times when people normally get to the lab?
17:20 &lt;sdumitriu1> Let's say 11-13 and 14-16
17:20 &lt;bvancea> ah
17:20 &lt;bvancea> ok
17:20 &lt;sdumitriu1> After 16 is getting too late for you
17:20 &lt;sdumitriu1> And before 11 people may not be available
17:21 &lt;bvancea> thats what I thoght when I wrote 11 and not 9 ;))
17:21 &lt;sdumitriu1> Wednesday's not good for you?
17:21 &lt;bvancea> not sure about the time wednesday
17:21 &lt;bvancea> we should be having some group pictures taken for the diploma
17:21 &lt;bvancea> with the whole year
17:22 &lt;bvancea> last time it was tried, half didnt show up
17:22 &lt;bvancea> I not sure how long that's gonna take
17:22 &lt;bvancea> and its set sometime between after AM my time
17:22 &lt;sdumitriu1> OK
17:25 &lt;bvancea> http://doodle.com/e49wse69ubd3c5wg
17:25 &lt;bvancea> are the times ok now?
17:26 &lt;bvancea> so I've figured I can come on wednesday aswell
17:26 &lt;bvancea> 14-16 toronto time
17:26 &lt;sdumitriu1> Times are wrong...
17:26 &lt;sdumitriu1> It's 2AM-4AM
17:27 &lt;bvancea> how about now?
17:27 &lt;sdumitriu1> 2AM-4PM
17:27 &lt;sdumitriu1> The 14-hours meeting, a great way to start the day
17:28 &lt;bvancea> :(
17:28 &lt;bvancea> should be only 2 hours now
17:30 &lt;sdumitriu1> Looks good
17:31 &lt;bvancea> you should be getting an email
17:31 &lt;bvancea> right about now
17:39 &lt;sdumitriu1> Did you invite the others as well?
17:39 &lt;sdumitriu1> Or you can send the link in a reply to my reply
17:44 &lt;bvancea> I invited everyone
17:44 &lt;bvancea> but its safer I send the reply as well
17:48 &lt;bvancea> gmail is so funny sometimes
17:48 &lt;bvancea> keeps asking me if I want to invite Medsavant to gmail
17:48 &lt;bvancea> :)
17:49 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yeah, I don't like social apps that invite every email address that's in in your GMail, and such invites are sent to mailing lists with thousands of subscribers...
17:50 &lt;bvancea> lol
17:50 &lt;sdumitriu1> If you see Miro on IRC before me, kindly remind him to send the weekly status email
17:50 &lt;bvancea> and every subscriber gets the invite email?
17:50 &lt;bvancea> he was on earlier today
17:51 &lt;bvancea> before lunch, my time
17:51 &lt;bvancea> I'll let him know tomorrow morning, if he's here
17:51 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes, but not for them personally, "dear GSoC students discussion list, you've been invited to join..."
17:51 &lt;bvancea> haha, that must be funny
17:51 &lt;bvancea> for the first 2 mails
17:51 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes, read the conversation
17:51 &lt;bvancea> then really annoying
17:52 &lt;bvancea> so, there's a big change the meeting is not friday evening
17:52 &lt;bvancea> my girlfriend will be happy
17:54 &lt;sdumitriu1> Tomorrow morning or Thursday seem the best candidates
17:54 &lt;sdumitriu1> Let's see what Miro says
17:55 &lt;bvancea> yup
17:56 &lt;bvancea> just noticed you asked how much it took to index the 700k variants
17:56 &lt;bvancea> around 3 minutes
17:56 &lt;bvancea> sorry, didn't see it
17:58 &lt;sdumitriu1> Decent, IMHO
17:58 &lt;bvancea> yeah
17:58 &lt;bvancea> I should check how much it takes medsavant to save the same numbers to the database
18:15 &lt;bvancea> who is Jim?
18:15 &lt;bvancea> :)
18:15 &lt;sdumitriu1> Our newest developer
18:15 &lt;sdumitriu1> Postdoc
18:15 &lt;bvancea> ah, cool
18:51 &lt;sdumitriu1> Going home
18:51 &lt;sdumitriu1> Bye
18:51 &lt;bvancea> bye
18:51 &lt;bvancea> I'll probably hit the bed too
18:51 &lt;bvancea> good night</content>
