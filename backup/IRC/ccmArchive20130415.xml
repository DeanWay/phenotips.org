11:05 &lt;Krinye> Hello wondering if anyone could help me again with questions about project timelines
11:05 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi Krinye
11:06 &lt;Krinye> Hi sdmitriu, I have been trying to get more detailed information, other than the wiki, but mark hasn't set me the documents yet
11:07 &lt;Krinye> I do not know what items to place on my timeline, at this point I am not sure if we are needed to generalize timelines or get into specifics
11:07 &lt;Krinye> I am kind of worried because the deadline is coming up and I still have to make time for exams and stuff
11:08 &lt;sdumitriu> The deadline isn't coming so soon
11:08 &lt;sdumitriu> The student registration didn't even start yet
11:09 &lt;Krinye> I applied last year and they really want the timelines to be specific.
11:10 &lt;sdumitriu> Well, that varies from organization to organization
11:10 &lt;Krinye> Although the registration is not yet here yet, I have to draft a proposal and have it critiqued before sending it in
11:10 &lt;sdumitriu> I know that timelines aren't something to be counted upon
11:10 &lt;sdumitriu> What's more important is seeing how much you understand what needs to be done
11:11 &lt;sdumitriu> I'll talk with Marc later today
11:12 &lt;Krinye> that would be great, is it possible to drop by the centre and talk to someone, get more info?
11:13 &lt;sdumitriu> Not to the CCM, since it's tougher security, but by the lab
11:14 &lt;sdumitriu> Pratt Bldg, Room 286
11:14 &lt;sdumitriu> You know where that is?
11:15 &lt;Krinye> near convocation hall front campus?
11:17 &lt;sdumitriu> http://goo.gl/maps/YvpYk
11:18 &lt;sdumitriu> Second floor
11:18 &lt;sdumitriu> Right in front of the stairs
11:18 &lt;sdumitriu> I'm not there yet, will be after 2
11:20 &lt;Krinye> thanks I will make it there today. Thanks

11:27 &lt;Anuja> Hi
11:30 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi Anuja
11:31 &lt;Anuja> I am interested in working on the project - Visualization and analysis of patient data for the diagnosis of genetic disorders
11:31 &lt;Anuja> I have some doubts regarding it
11:32 &lt;sdumitriu> OK
11:32 &lt;Anuja> Is it a right time to ask ?
11:34 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
11:35 &lt;aciid> hi
11:35 &lt;Anuja> What methods will be considered from retrieving patients with similar manfestations?
11:35 &lt;aciid> I am interested in making iOS app
11:36 &lt;aciid> i sent a mail to  vcell-discuss@googlegroups.com but no reply :(
11:36 &lt;Anuja> Example - One way i can think is, if each patient is represented by a vector of attribute than cosine similarity can be used for finding similar patients
11:36 &lt;Anuja> like how its dont in recommendation systems
11:36 &lt;Anuja> *done
11:37 &lt;sdumitriu> aciid: We're not affiliated with vcell
11:37 &lt;aciid> Oh
11:37 &lt;aciid> do you know how do i contact them?
11:38 &lt;sdumitriu> They're part of NRNB
11:38 &lt;aciid> do they have an irc channel?
11:40 &lt;sdumitriu> vcell-discuss seems to be the right channel
11:40 &lt;sdumitriu> So you should wait some more for a reply
11:40 &lt;sdumitriu> When did you contact them?
11:40 &lt;aciid> some 3 days ago
11:40 &lt;sdumitriu> It's been a weekend, wait until tomorrow
11:40 &lt;sdumitriu> If still no answer, write a follow-up email
11:41 &lt;aciid> okay
11:41 &lt;aciid> thank you :)
11:41 &lt;froggy> I have some queries related to savant android version
11:41 &lt;sdumitriu> You're welcome
11:41 &lt;sdumitriu> froggy: Hold on, I still have to answer Anuja
11:41 &lt;froggy> ok go on
11:42 &lt;sdumitriu> Anuja: Yes, patients already have a list of phenotypes, and other observations
11:42 &lt;sdumitriu> So indeed the goal is to select other patients with similar phenotypes
11:43 &lt;sdumitriu> How exactly to measure the similarity is something to analyze together with the mentors
11:43 &lt;sdumitriu> So one goal of the project is to find a good measure
11:44 &lt;sdumitriu> The other goal is to make a nice UI for exploring the patients network
11:44 &lt;aciid> has left #ccm
11:45 &lt;Anuja> I have experience in Hibernate, Tomcat, Struts
11:45 &lt;Anuja> I need to brush up javascript and CSS though
11:46 &lt;Anuja> Also will it involve clustering algorithms?
11:47 &lt;sdumitriu> Probably yes
11:48 &lt;Anuja> okay thanks :)
11:48 &lt;Anuja> Can you also tell what is expected from the mentee and a project proposal ?
11:49 &lt;Anuja> Also will the main focus be on UI or on the algorithms being used. I can learn advance UI stuff in case needed
11:54 &lt;sdumitriu> Both
11:55 &lt;sdumitriu> But any of these done well is good enough
11:57 &lt;Anuja> Ok cool, Thanks a ton :) . Will bother you in case of any further doubts
12:01 &lt;froggy> sdumitriu: ping
12:01 &lt;sdumitriu> Pong
12:01 &lt;froggy> :P

13:53 &lt;sdumitriu1> has joined #ccm
14:30 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hey froggy, did you get in touch with Marc?
14:31 &lt;froggy> no, his nick ?
14:31 &lt;sdumitriu1> Not here, let me fetch him
14:31 &lt;froggy> i did send a mail . ok do that
14:38 &lt;mfiume> has joined #ccm
14:39 &lt;mfiume> Hi froggy, what's up?
14:39 &lt;froggy> hi, so You marc
14:39 &lt;mfiume> Yes I am :)
14:41 &lt;froggy> so i have a query for the savant android version
14:41 &lt;froggy> do you have an api for it ? ie for the android client
14:42 &lt;froggy> what sort of data are we talking about which is to be parsed in the android client
14:42 &lt;mfiume> no, the project will involve creating an API from the existing Java platform
14:42 &lt;mfiume> the data is genomics data
14:43 &lt;mfiume> the API should communicate via JSON elements
14:43 &lt;froggy> a rest api /
14:43 &lt;froggy> ?
14:43 &lt;mfiume> preferrably
14:44 &lt;froggy> man ! Its sad then . I came for android client . I know how to deal with api from android but i am inexperinced in creating apis
14:47 &lt;mfiume> Unfortunately this project will involve creating an API
14:56 &lt;froggy> ok ! maybe i will come next year after the api is completed to consume it through my android client
14:56 &lt;froggy> :)
14:57 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hey froggy, there's https://gsoc.ccm.sickkids.ca/GoogleSummerOfCode/Mobile+UI+for+the+Pedigree+tool
14:57 &lt;froggy> wait . how did i miss that ! lemme see
15:07 &lt;froggy> has left #ccm
15:10 &lt;froggy> has joined #ccm
15:20 &lt;froggy> hi sdumitriu1 , went through the idea .
15:20 &lt;froggy> so where can i learn more about pedigree
15:21 &lt;froggy> where is the code for the pedigree web app ?
15:22 &lt;froggy> so basically , the idea is to implement the pedigree tool in android ?
15:23 &lt;qwebirc85263> has joined #ccm
15:23 &lt;sdumitriu1> You can see a demo at http://phenotips.org/edit/data/P0000016?sheet=PhenoTips.PedigreeEditor#
15:23 &lt;sdumitriu1> Nope, discard that link, it's broken
15:23 &lt;sdumitriu1> http://phenotips.org/data/
15:23 &lt;sdumitriu1> Click on New patient record
15:24 &lt;sdumitriu1> And in the Family History section, click on Draw Pedigree
15:24 &lt;sdumitriu1> The code is in https://github.com/compbio-UofT/phenotips/tree/master/pedigree
15:26 &lt;froggy> unable to click on new patient record
15:27 &lt;froggy> no onclick listener :P
15:27 &lt;sdumitriu1> That's normal, there should never be onclick listeners in a good web page
15:27 &lt;sdumitriu1> It's supposed to be a link
15:27 &lt;sdumitriu1> Nope, not a link, a form submit button
15:28 &lt;froggy> yes i was kidding . Its not working
15:28 &lt;sdumitriu1> Ah, I see
15:28 &lt;froggy> ie the link
15:28 &lt;sdumitriu1> That button...
15:28 &lt;sdumitriu1> There was supposed to be another one at the bottom, but it's not there anymore...
15:29 &lt;froggy> i edited a patient record
15:29 &lt;froggy> now i am inside a record
15:30 &lt;froggy> ok got it
15:31 &lt;froggy> so viewing the pedigree o/p
15:34 &lt;froggy> so the form data creates the pedigree output ?
15:36 &lt;froggy> Android has opengl es libs to help draw shapes accorcing to inputs in a form .
15:37 &lt;froggy> ie . it can work on the same lines as pedigree if that is the working principle
15:37 &lt;sdumitriu1> We'd like to have this not as a native application, but as a web app
15:37 &lt;sdumitriu1> HTML+JS+CSS+SVG
15:38 &lt;froggy> but pedigree is already a web app i guess
15:38 &lt;sdumitriu1> So most of the app already exists, what it needs is to make it work with touch events instead of onclick and onmouseover
15:38 &lt;froggy> i am viewing it in a browser right now
15:38 &lt;sdumitriu1> (which don't exist on mobile devices)
15:39 &lt;froggy> o i get it
15:40 &lt;froggy> Ok i get it ! You want it to be used in the browser of the mobile device ? Yes it can be done . But you can always create native android/ios app for it ?
16:00 &lt;sdumitriu1> froggy: The new patient record button should work now
16:01 &lt;froggy> ok . i just had to view the pedigree tool once . already did that
16:23 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> has joined #ccm
16:35 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi kushalkhandelwal
16:38 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Hi sdumitriu
16:39 &lt;sdumitriu> Were you looking for the mentors?
16:39 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Yes I am looking
16:39 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Can you tell me more about " Real-time collection of clinical data on patients with genetic disorders using various medical ontologies"
16:39 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> this idea
16:40 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> how should I go about it
16:41 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> sdumitriu, ?
16:46 &lt;sdumitriu> Just so I know where to start explaining, did you take a look at PhenoTips? Did you understand what it does?
16:52 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Yes , I had a look at phenotips and have a gist of what it does
16:53 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> sorry for the frequent disconnection , some power failure issues at my university
16:53 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> From what I understand , it collects and analyzes the patient data
16:54 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> it suggests clinical investigations
16:54 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> helps in diagnosis
16:54 &lt;sdumitriu> Yep
16:55 &lt;sdumitriu> So, the most important part is the patient's phenotipic description, all the symptomps observed
16:56 &lt;sdumitriu> And in order to have this data in a reusable manner, it is stored not as free text, but as terms from an ontology
16:56 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> So one challenge is to accurately record the symptoms observed
16:56 &lt;sdumitriu> "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder" is stored as HP:0007018
16:57 &lt;sdumitriu> Now, while we like HPO because it's open, it's easy to improve, and so  far it's pretty comprehensive, most existing applications use other  standards
16:57 &lt;sdumitriu> Most of the hospital where we deployed PhenoTips asked about ICD9, ICD10 or LDD
16:57 &lt;sdumitriu> So the goal is to do the same thing that's happening now, but instead of using terms from HPO, use terms from ICD10 or LDD
16:58 &lt;sdumitriu> The administrator should be able to chose among the available ontologies
16:58 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Ok , so we need to find the links in HPO and ICD10 and map them
16:59 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> As I know from what i have heard around from doctors , ICD is the most common classification
17:15 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> sdumitriu, ?
17:16 &lt;sdumitriu> kushalkhandelwal: That's not the goal of the project, since it probably requires a lot of work
17:16 &lt;sdumitriu> (there are 10.000 terms in HPO, and much more in ICD)
17:17 &lt;sdumitriu> How it works right now is that the HPO is indexed in a Solr server
17:17 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> ok
17:17 &lt;sdumitriu> And when the user searches for something using free text, the best matches from the Solr index are retrieved and display
17:18 &lt;sdumitriu> HPO has not just an ID, but also a name and a description of each term
17:19 &lt;sdumitriu> So we match doctor's words agains the name and the description, and while we display the Name field to the user, we store the ID field in the database
17:19 &lt;sdumitriu> So, the goal is to do the same for ICD10
17:19 &lt;sdumitriu> Since terms in ICD10 also have identifier, name and description
17:20 &lt;sdumitriu> So instead of searching in the indexed HPO, we search in the indexed ICD ontology and store terms from it
17:21 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> Ok , so we have an option to chose from available ontologies
17:21 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
17:21 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> use ICD10 or HPO
17:21 &lt;sdumitriu> The main problem after that is that existing patient records won't be updated automatically
17:21 &lt;sdumitriu> This is where the mapping between ontologies would be helpful
17:22 &lt;sdumitriu> But it's outside the scope of this project
17:22 &lt;sdumitriu> So you don't have to worry about that
17:23 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> So we don't have to update the current records
17:23 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> and only implement the new ontology for new patients
17:23 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
17:26 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> So the goal of the project would be to provide an interface to chose between available ontologies , Index the new ontology
17:27 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
17:29 &lt;kushalkhandelwal&gt; So I have forked the code , would go through the codebase
17:29 &lt;kushalkhandelwal> I know a little bit about Solr , so need to know more about it
