13:12 &lt;bvancea> hey sdumitriu
13:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hey bvancea
13:13 &lt;bvancea> sorry for checking in so late, the last 24 hours have been pretty rough for me
13:14 &lt;bvancea> but I've finally managed to get my diploma paper printed :D
13:15 &lt;sdumitriu1> Congrats, you're a BSc
13:15 &lt;bvancea> hehe
13:15 &lt;bvancea> well, I still have my exam
13:15 &lt;bvancea> monday I think
13:17 &lt;sdumitriu1> Oh, I see
13:17 &lt;sdumitriu1> I thought you got the diploma
13:18 &lt;bvancea> nah
13:18 &lt;bvancea> one of the advisors sent some feedback last night
13:18 &lt;sdumitriu1> Was wondering how could that happen...
13:18 &lt;bvancea> and asked if I have enough time to add an additional test
13:18 &lt;bvancea> and I was like, "I think so"
13:19 &lt;bvancea> sadly, it didn't go as planned and I've spent a good part of last night working on it
13:19 &lt;bvancea> since tomorrow is the due date for the handing in of the printed diploma papers
13:19 &lt;bvancea> and you need to print with one day in advance because of the cover
13:20 &lt;bvancea> it was pretty hard to find a place where they'd print the cover in the same day
13:21 &lt;bvancea> since I didn't want to leave it for tomorrow
13:22 &lt;bvancea> anyway, its printed, its perfect, gonna hand it in tomorrow morning and then stop thinking about it until the exam
13:23 &lt;sdumitriu1> Do you have your presentation ready?
13:23 &lt;bvancea> I have the presentation I've used for the local conference
13:23 &lt;bvancea> I did some modifications to it
13:23 &lt;bvancea> to fit in the timespan allocated
13:24 &lt;bvancea> and I'll have a practice presentation session with the reasearch group + advisors
13:24 &lt;bvancea> friday
13:24 &lt;bvancea> so I'll just do my think friday and then include what feedback they have for the actual presentation
13:25 &lt;bvancea> do my thing*
13:26 &lt;bvancea> anyway, back to more pressing issues
13:27 &lt;bvancea> for the remainder of today I'll keep working on the translator
13:27 &lt;sdumitriu1> Progressing?
13:27 &lt;bvancea> not as much as I wanted to
13:28 &lt;bvancea> with all the distractions
13:28 &lt;bvancea> I'll close to finishing something simple
13:28 &lt;bvancea> I'm*
13:28 &lt;bvancea> for the basic select querries
13:29 &lt;bvancea> I was sort of worried not to "copy" the grammar from the xwiki example
13:29 &lt;bvancea> until I found the BNF for JPQL in the java ee documentation
13:30 &lt;bvancea> and it's pretty much the same
13:30 &lt;bvancea> :D
13:37 &lt;bvancea> btw, do you know if Marc had a chance to create the list of entities for MedSavant?
14:06 &lt;sdumitriu1> Asked him
14:06 &lt;sdumitriu1> Waiting for a reply
14:06 &lt;sdumitriu1> It would probably be easier to go to him
14:08 &lt;sdumitriu1> He didn't
14:15 &lt;bvancea> oh
14:15 &lt;bvancea> well, I've made that list
14:15 &lt;bvancea> revised it earlier this week
14:16 &lt;bvancea> maybe he'll get the opportunity to review it
