11:19 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hey BogdanVancea
11:19 &lt;sdumitriu1> What are you working on?
11:19 &lt;BogdanVancea> Hello sdumitriu1
11:19 &lt;BogdanVancea> checking out some code
11:19 &lt;BogdanVancea> on Medsavant
11:19 &lt;BogdanVancea> I was getting ready to send out a mail on the dev mailing list
11:19 &lt;BogdanVancea> ;))
11:20 &lt;BogdanVancea> and how are you?
11:21 &lt;sdumitriu1> Very busy... Lots of work to do, I just got another batch of requests last night
11:21 &lt;sdumitriu1> Most of them I've fixed already, but there are some major refactorings needed
11:22 &lt;BogdanVancea> I see
11:24 &lt;BogdanVancea> and you're working on Phenotips?
11:24 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
11:25 &lt;BogdanVancea> ah
11:25 &lt;BogdanVancea> I'm wondering, should I use the dev mailing list for all the questions I have about the project?
11:26 &lt;BogdanVancea> sincer it's mostly just you on the irc
11:27 &lt;sdumitriu1> Well, if they're important questions, send them by email
11:28 &lt;sdumitriu1> But if it's something quick I might be able to answer faster here
11:28 &lt;sdumitriu1> I'm sorry that Marc isn't more available, but this summer he's very busy, caught between several obligations
11:29 &lt;BogdanVancea> it's okay
11:30 &lt;BogdanVancea> I'll just ask you then :)
11:30 &lt;BogdanVancea> is Medsavant fully ported to Maven?
11:30 &lt;BogdanVancea> I havent seen any major changes on the github repo
11:31 &lt;sdumitriu1> I still have to commit the Maven build
11:31 &lt;BogdanVancea> I see
11:31 &lt;sdumitriu1> The problem is that there are many dependencies that don't have a Maven artefact available
11:31 &lt;sdumitriu1> So I'm trying to find and build each such project to resolve the Jar hell...
11:32 &lt;BogdanVancea> ugh, that's not a very fun task
11:32 &lt;sdumitriu1> I think I'll push what I have so far
11:32 &lt;sdumitriu1> Indeed
11:32 &lt;BogdanVancea> ;))
11:32 &lt;sdumitriu1> I spent a couple of days looking for projects
11:34 &lt;sdumitriu1> But this is normal lab software development, it's gonna be a while until I can instill some good practices
11:34 &lt;BogdanVancea> hehe
11:34 &lt;BogdanVancea> I like the checkstyle plugin
11:34 &lt;BogdanVancea> for Maven
11:35 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yep, it's great
11:35 &lt;BogdanVancea> the one you had set up for Phenotips
11:36 &lt;BogdanVancea> also, could I use Spring for the development on Medsavant?
11:37 &lt;BogdanVancea> once the project is fully mavenized
11:39 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hm, I think that's a major change
11:39 &lt;sdumitriu1> It's too dangerous
11:39 &lt;sdumitriu1> I agree that it should be componentized somehow, but you should focus on your own goals
11:41 &lt;BogdanVancea> I was asking because I used spring data in the past for working with Solr
11:42 &lt;BogdanVancea> but maybe it's better if I do something similar to what you did on phenotips
12:25 &lt;sdumitriu1> Still waiting for that email from you...
12:30 &lt;BogdanVancea> sorry, I received a call and didn't manage to finish it up
12:30 &lt;BogdanVancea> you mean the mail to the dev list, containing what I plan to do this week, right?
12:31 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
12:32 &lt;sdumitriu1> As you said, "I was getting ready to send out a mail on the dev mailing list"
12:32 &lt;BogdanVancea> that's true, it's half written
12:32 &lt;BogdanVancea> but I started to ask you some questions
12:35 &lt;marta> has joined #medsavant
12:46 &lt;BogdanVancea> sent the email
12:46 &lt;BogdanVancea> hello Marta
12:47 &lt;marta> hi BogdanVancea
12:49 &lt;BogdanVancea> are you also an active dev for Medsavant?
12:54 &lt;marta> no, but i'm one of the ccm org admins which means i have to keep an eye on all gsoc projects
12:54 &lt;BogdanVancea> oh, I see
12:57 &lt;BogdanVancea> is everyone subscribed to the dev list for medsavant?
12:58 &lt;BogdanVancea> since I've sent the last mail just to the medsavant dev list
12:58 &lt;BogdanVancea> should I include more people in the cc field when I send more emails?
12:58 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes, everybody involved is subscribed
12:59 &lt;BogdanVancea> ah, ok
13:00 &lt;BogdanVancea> you said in the email you've send the other day that there was a try to add Solr support for medsavant
13:01 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes, Brian said he'll search for the code
13:02 &lt;BogdanVancea> ah, okay
13:03 &lt;BogdanVancea> and it didnt work?
13:04 &lt;sdumitriu1> Not really, it took a day to index just a few genomes, with only a few attributes
13:04 &lt;sdumitriu1> And that was considered too much
13:05 &lt;BogdanVancea> ah
13:05 &lt;sdumitriu1> So the experiment didn't go too far
13:06 &lt;BogdanVancea> I did some tests indexing data myself
13:06 &lt;BogdanVancea> and it was really slow if you index over http
13:07 &lt;sdumitriu1> Well, it's going to be slow anyway
13:07 &lt;marta> correction: not a few genomes, they indexed one chromosome
13:07 &lt;marta> a small one :)
13:07 &lt;sdumitriu1> That's why sharding is important
13:07 &lt;marta> +1
13:08 &lt;sdumitriu1> And we'll have to accept that indexing big data sets is slow, and rethink the software a bit
13:08 &lt;BogdanVancea> hmm
13:08 &lt;BogdanVancea> how large is a chromosome?
13:08 &lt;sdumitriu1> Instead of starting with an empty database everytime, either package a pre-indexed starting core, or use a remote service
13:08 &lt;BogdanVancea> roughly, how much data?
13:09 &lt;BogdanVancea> And the indexing part is sort of tricky
13:10 &lt;BogdanVancea> sincer at the moment Solr has a fixed configuration
13:10 &lt;BogdanVancea> and you'd need to reindex everything if you want more shards
13:34 &lt;BogdanVancea> awesome :D
13:34 &lt;BogdanVancea> this means I can build the project with a different IDE than Netbeans?
13:36 &lt;sdumitriu1> I'm not sure
13:37 &lt;sdumitriu1> It compiles, but last time I tried to run it it didn't work
13:37 &lt;BogdanVancea> I'll give it a try
13:37 &lt;sdumitriu1> There may be something wrong
14:37 &lt;sdumitriu1> BogdanVancea: Any success with the build?
14:39 &lt;BogdanVancea> no, it fails
14:39 &lt;BogdanVancea> but I need to get the latest commits
14:39 &lt;BogdanVancea> and try again
14:39 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
14:39 &lt;sdumitriu1> It should work after that, since it correctly works on http://ci.cs.toronto.edu/jenkins/
14:40 &lt;BogdanVancea> it keeps downloading jars
14:40 &lt;BogdanVancea> so its fine until now
14:43 &lt;BogdanVancea> build succesfull
14:43 &lt;BogdanVancea> awesome
15:21 &lt;BogdanVancea> sdumitriu, did you manage to run it succesfully?
15:22 &lt;sdumitriu1> No, I've switched back to PhenoTips
15:23 &lt;BogdanVancea> ah, okay
15:33 &lt;BogdanVancea> I think I'm going to go for a shower and then to bed
15:33 &lt;sdumitriu1> OK
15:34 &lt;BogdanVancea> talk to you tomorrow then
15:34 &lt;BogdanVancea> gnite
15:34 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yep
15:34 &lt;sdumitriu1> Good night
