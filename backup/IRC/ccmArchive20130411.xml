13:55 &lt;qwebirc30748> hi
13:56 &lt;qwebirc30748> i would like to contribute to GSoc 2013
13:57 &lt;qwebirc30748> in computational medicine
13:57 &lt;qwebirc30748> i need help
13:58 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi qwebirc30748
13:58 &lt;qwebirc30748> finally someone responded
13:59 &lt;sdumitriu> Sorry, we're all a bit busy at an event
14:01 &lt;qwebirc81245> has joined #ccm
14:01 &lt;qwebirc30748> can you answer my few questions right now... or you are like very busy?
14:03 &lt;sdumitriu> I'll try
14:03 &lt;sdumitriu> Go ahead
14:05 &lt;qwebirc30748> i have some skills on java and GUI development... are there any projects suitable for me?
14:05 &lt;sdumitriu> GUI in Java?
14:05 &lt;sdumitriu> Or GUI in general?
14:05 &lt;sdumitriu> Java is perfect, almost all of the projects involve Java
14:06 &lt;qwebirc30748> GUI in Java
14:07 &lt;sdumitriu> OK, Savant and MedSavant have that
14:07 &lt;sdumitriu> But the idea is to move away from GUIs in Java to rich web clients
14:08 &lt;sdumitriu> Do you have any web development experience, especially on the client side (JS, CSS)
14:08 &lt;qwebirc30748> but i am also intrested in web apps especially in Ruby on Rails... will that be of any use?
14:09 &lt;qwebirc30748> actually i have developed a small app in Ruby on Rails which visualizes data using Google visualization API
14:09 &lt;qwebirc30748&gt; can such knowledge be of any use?
14:09 &lt;sdumitriu> Ruby, no
14:10 &lt;sdumitriu> What's good about RoR is that it uses Prototype.js, which is what we're using in PhenoTips
14:10 &lt;qwebirc30748> so can i be of any use in any of your projects?
14:11 &lt;qwebirc30748> actually this is what i have developed.. you can have a quick look http://track-data.herokuapp.com/
14:15 &lt;sushilthe> has joined #ccm
14:15 &lt;sushilthe> ok sdumitriu i am the one talking about the RoR
14:15 &lt;sushilthe> sorry for the disruption
14:15 &lt;sushilthe> my coneection lost
14:16 &lt;sushilthe> please can you suggest me something upto my knowledge?
14:16 &lt;vshivam> has joined #ccm
14:16 &lt;sdumitriu> sushilthe: Nice app
14:17 &lt;sushilthe> Thank You
14:17 &lt;sdumitriu> So, you'd like something visual, and which should involve Java
14:17 &lt;sdumitriu> Or the other way around, something in Java, which should also be visual?
14:18 &lt;vshivam> Hi!
14:18 &lt;vshivam> I wanted to work on -- Mobile application for chronic disease management
14:18 &lt;sushilthe> yeah.. that's what i think would fit me
14:18 &lt;vshivam> for Gsoc 13
14:18 &lt;vshivam> can someone please guide me on how to get started ?
14:21 &lt;sdumitriu> sushilthe: What do you think about this? https://gsoc.ccm.sickkids.ca/GoogleSummerOfCode/Savant+Touch+%28Android+Version+of+Savant%29
14:22 &lt;sdumitriu> vshivam: Hi, the mentor for that project isn't here at the moment, you should send him an email to get more information
14:22 &lt;sushilthe> Do you think it is ok for me?
14:22 &lt;sushilthe> does it fit my knowledge area
14:22 &lt;vshivam> sdumitriu : thanks, will do
14:23 &lt;qwebirc81245> hi
14:24 &lt;qwebirc81245> Hi shivam, where are u from?
14:25 &lt;sdumitriu> sushilthe: It involves a lot of Java and GUI, but it also requires Android development
14:26 &lt;sushilthe> does it means that i must have all the knowledge about Android development?
14:28 &lt;sdumitriu> Well, GSoC is about learning, so it's not strongly required to know any of the technologies
14:28 &lt;sdumitriu> But since the number of slots is limited, we'll prefer to take someone that knows more
14:28 &lt;vshivam> hi qwebirc81245
14:28 &lt;vshivam> India
14:29 &lt;sdumitriu> Since GSoC is for students, it's expected not to get experts, but young minds willing to learn under the guidance of senior developers
14:30 &lt;sushilthe> that's fine... so what do you think i should be doing right now
14:30 &lt;sushilthe> should i be trying to develop some Android apps?
14:30 &lt;sushilthe> show my progress... make you believe that i can do it... or is there something else?
14:35 &lt;sdumitriu> sushilthe: Contact Marc, the mentor for that project, asking for more information
14:37 &lt;sushilthe> i have already done that
14:37 &lt;sdumitriu> K
14:37 &lt;sdumitriu> Try to get the hang of Savant
14:37 &lt;sdumitriu> See if you can get it to build (hint: it only works in NetBeans, we
14:37 &lt;sdumitriu> 're going to improve that)
14:38 &lt;sushilthe> can you show me the source of the savant?
14:38 &lt;sushilthe> a link
14:38 &lt;sdumitriu> Play with it, see what it can do
14:38 &lt;sushilthe> maybe
14:38 &lt;sdumitriu> And try to understand the code a bit
14:38 &lt;sushilthe> ok.... i'll be doing that
14:38 &lt;sdumitriu> http://www.genomesavant.com/p/savant/download
14:38 &lt;sushilthe> will it be any good if i contribute some bug fix or tweak some feature?
14:39 &lt;sdumitriu> The code is currently here: https://svn2.assembla.com/svn/savant/Savant/trunk/
14:39 &lt;sdumitriu> We're in the process of moving it to GitHub, so if you prefer git, you can look at https://github.com/compbio-UofT/savant
14:39 &lt;sdumitriu> But it's a tiny bit outdated
14:40 &lt;sushilthe> ok thanks for the github link.... i am kind of a github guy
14:41 &lt;sushilthe> can this code be tested in eclipse?
14:41 &lt;sdumitriu> Nope
14:41 &lt;sdumitriu> Not yet
14:41 &lt;sdumitriu> I have to push my changes which make it work in any environment
14:41 &lt;sdumitriu> But I didn't have time to finish that move
14:42 &lt;sushilthe> i think it is in netbeans... i don't know if android can be setup in netbeans...
14:42 &lt;sushilthe> ok
14:42 &lt;sdumitriu> It should happen soon
14:47 &lt;sushilthe> will it be fine.. if i use github?

16:10 &lt;ravigarg27> sdumitriu, I tried working around Phenotips and have understood many of its functions. I was also exploring on how to implement the project and got stuck at one place about the description of the input data. Can you please brief me what the input will be like?
16:12 &lt;sdumitriu> That's about https://gsoc.ccm.sickkids.ca/GoogleSummerOfCode/Extraction+of+ontology+terms+from+free+form+clinical+notes right?
16:12 &lt;ravigarg27> yup
16:12 &lt;ravigarg27> Specifically, Will the input be like full description text or just only the phenotype terms
16:13 &lt;sdumitriu> Well, hard to say
16:13 &lt;sdumitriu> Depends on the doctor
16:13 &lt;sdumitriu> Getting something useful out of both kinds of data would be perfect
16:14 &lt;ravigarg27> hehe ok yeah so will have to include the preprocessing the algorithm
