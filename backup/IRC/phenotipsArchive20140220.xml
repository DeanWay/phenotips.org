09:43 &lt;sdumitriu1> has quit
09:46 &lt;akats> Ok. No problem. I've got a bunch of little things to fix.
14:24 &lt;mcupak> has quit
15:54 &lt;akats> This is not important, but just wanted to tell you that the boost for the Solr is not working. omitNorms=false didn't help. From debugQuery=on it appears that the boost info never gets stored. The situation is not remedied by putting boost into the &lt;field> or &lt;doc>

16:23 &lt;sdumitriu> akats: Can you try to use this instead? http://wiki.apache.org/solr/Suggester
18:09 &lt;akats> How about we forget about boosting results and just sort them by population. I can't get the suggester to work with boosts either plus it comes with another problem - it only returns one word, not the whole name field.
18:09 &lt;sdumitriu> Sounds good
18:10 &lt;sdumitriu> That was my backup plan, explicit sorting
18:10 &lt;sdumitriu> Or wait, where do you want to sort?
18:10 &lt;sdumitriu> Solr has a param for that
18:10 &lt;akats> I was guessing that it would
18:11 &lt;akats> Was just hoping it would be as easy as sticking it into a query
18:11 &lt;akats> By the way do you want me to leave the suggester enabled in solr, or do you want me to remove it?
18:11 &lt;sdumitriu> Better remove it
18:12 &lt;akats> ok no problem
