09:57 &lt;krinye> Hello any mentors around
10:01 &lt;sdumitriu> Hi krinye
10:02 &lt;sdumitriu> Read your messages on Melange
10:02 &lt;sdumitriu> Have a little patience

11:08 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hey, lots of people today
11:08 &lt;sdumitriu1> Let's see, does anybody want to fix an easy issue? https://github.com/compbio-UofT/phenotips/issues?labels=easy

13:10 &lt;BogdanVancea> sdumitriu, how does the contributing work for phenotips?
13:11 &lt;BogdanVancea> can I just issue a pull request with my fix?
13:11 &lt;sdumitriu1> BogdanVancea: Yes
13:11 &lt;sdumitriu1> What issue?
13:11 &lt;BogdanVancea> https://github.com/compbio-UofT/phenotips/issues/432
13:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> Cool
13:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes, a Pull Request is the best way
13:13 &lt;BogdanVancea> Okay
13:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> Are you familiar with GitHub?
13:13 &lt;BogdanVancea> I'll test it for a while
13:14 &lt;BogdanVancea> and the issue a pull request
13:14 &lt;BogdanVancea> a bit familiar
13:14 &lt;BogdanVancea> I forked the repo
13:14 &lt;BogdanVancea> and will push the changes, then issue the pull request
13:14 &lt;BogdanVancea> that's the model, right?
13:16 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
13:16 &lt;sdumitriu1> Keep in mind that commits for pull requests should go in a dedicated branch
13:16 &lt;sdumitriu1> One branch per issue
13:17 &lt;sdumitriu1> Otherwise if you're trying to do more than one pull request from the same branch it won't work
13:20 &lt;BogdanVancea> I see
13:20 &lt;BogdanVancea> thank you
13:21 &lt;sdumitriu1> What project are you applying for?
13:21 &lt;BogdanVancea> the Solr backend for MedSavant
13:21 &lt;BogdanVancea> but since there are no issues there
13:21 &lt;BogdanVancea> and I was a little bored
13:21 &lt;BogdanVancea> I thought I'd give this one a try
13:24 &lt;BogdanVancea> It would seem I'm not quite done on the fix for #432, my version only displays the first OMIM disease :)
13:24 &lt;sdumitriu1> But that's a good start :)
13:25 &lt;BogdanVancea> yeah, I'll keep working on it :)
13:25 &lt;sdumitriu1> Did you manage to run MedSavant?
13:27 &lt;BogdanVancea> yes, I have
13:28 &lt;BogdanVancea> I got it to launch the login panel
13:28 &lt;BogdanVancea> but it displayed no buttons, just 2 inputs
13:29 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hm..
13:29 &lt;sdumitriu1> That sounds like a bug
13:30 &lt;BogdanVancea> well, I remember I changed some code
13:30 &lt;BogdanVancea> to get it to run
13:30 &lt;BogdanVancea> but it was just hardcoding some properties
13:30 &lt;BogdanVancea> I was running it on linux

14:24 &lt;BogdanVancea> yay
14:24 &lt;BogdanVancea> :)
14:25 &lt;BogdanVancea> This was my first fix for an open source project and my first pull request. It feels really nice :)
14:25 &lt;sdumitriu1> Are you on twitter?
14:25 &lt;BogdanVancea> yes
14:26 &lt;BogdanVancea> @BogdanVancea
14:33 &lt;sdumitriu1> So, did you prepare the application?
14:33 &lt;sdumitriu1> Don't delay, submit today!

15:10 &lt;BogdanVancea> sdumitriu, regarding the MedSavant issue I told you about earlier, it turned out to be an error on my side, I wasn't running with the porper java version.
15:10 &lt;BogdanVancea> So, there's no bug :)
15:11 &lt;sdumitriu1> Ah, good to know
15:11 &lt;sdumitriu1> Which version was that?
15:12 &lt;BogdanVancea> I have java 1.8 installed and I had to set the JDK for the MedSavant client to JDK 1.7 to get it to run
15:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> 8 already?
15:13 &lt;sdumitriu1> Anyway, that's still a bug
15:13 &lt;BogdanVancea> Ubuntu software updated asked, I wasn;t paying attention
15:13 &lt;BogdanVancea> so it installed
15:15 &lt;BogdanVancea> And it seems the MedSavantServerEngine only runs on 1.6
15:15 &lt;BogdanVancea> gives compile error on 1.7
15:16 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes, I think there's a problem with a JDBC connector interface
15:16 &lt;sdumitriu1> They keep adding methods to it, and so the classes that implement that interface must also add those methods
15:16 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hm, this is an idea for a pull request for you
15:16 &lt;sdumitriu1> Fix the compilation errors
15:16 &lt;BogdanVancea> and allow it to run on 1.7?
15:16 &lt;BogdanVancea> cool
15:17 &lt;BogdanVancea> I'll get on it
15:17 &lt;BogdanVancea> :)
15:36 &lt;roque> has joined #ccm
15:53 &lt;BogdanVancea> sdumitriu1, is MedSavant supposed to not download the GeneMania data when creating a new project?
15:54 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hm, I have no idea
15:55 &lt;sdumitriu1> I've had little experience with MedSavant, Marc is the main developer
15:55 &lt;BogdanVancea> I see
15:55 &lt;sdumitriu1> I'm just mentoring the Solr part of the project
15:56 &lt;BogdanVancea> I understand :)

16:19 &lt;BogdanVancea> Okay :)
16:20 &lt;vshivam> has joined #ccm
16:21 &lt;vshivam> sdumitriu: Hi !
16:21 &lt;sdumitriu1> Hi vshivam
16:22 &lt;vshivam> Hey ! I was submitting a proposal for the development of an Android Application for chronic disease management
16:22 &lt;vshivam> I tried contacting Marc through email. I suppose he's been pretty busy
16:22 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
16:23 &lt;vshivam> There are a lot of open ends in the project
16:23 &lt;sdumitriu1> You should write to ccm-mentors, not to Marc personally
16:23 &lt;vshivam> I had.
16:24 &lt;vshivam> I wanted to know about the disease we'll be developing the application for
16:24 &lt;vshivam> or any other ideas.
16:24 &lt;sdumitriu1> You're supposed to pick one
16:25 &lt;sdumitriu1> How about asthma?
16:25 &lt;sdumitriu1> Not sure if it's a good idea...
16:25 &lt;sdumitriu1> I shouldn't step on Marc's projects
16:26 &lt;vshivam> neither am I about any particular disease.
16:26 &lt;sdumitriu1> Well, do you have any ideas?
16:27 &lt;vshivam> I read a few research papers
16:28 &lt;vshivam> also, I was thinking if we could come up with an application about managing cigarette consumption
16:29 &lt;khodeir> has joined #ccm
16:29 &lt;vshivam> or for monitoring Cholestrol levels
16:30 &lt;vshivam> and if we are able to integrate the application with a device used for monitoring Blood pressure levels
16:33 &lt;vshivam> and monitor blood pressure levels for heart patients
16:33 &lt;vshivam> it can be a good idea.
16:34 &lt;vshivam> but I am not really sure about the feasibility of these ideas.
16:36 &lt;vshivam> sdumitriu: ?
16:36 &lt;sdumitriu1> To me they sound good
16:37 &lt;vshivam> Is there a way I can discuss this with him ?
16:39 &lt;sdumitriu1> You should send a follow-up email
16:39 &lt;sdumitriu1> I'll ping him tomorrow as well
16:39 &lt;vshivam> okay, will do.
16:41 &lt;sdumitriu1> Oh, you're waiting for a reply since the 18th...
16:41 &lt;vshivam> yeah. sort of. 19th I had sent the last email.
16:42 &lt;vshivam> I came to the irc a few days ago but marta said he was busy.
17:00 &lt;BogdanVancea> sdumitru, do you have some time to answer some questions regarding MedSavant and Solr?
17:01 &lt;sdumitriu1> I can try
17:01 &lt;sdumitriu1> Today is not a good day for science, it seems
17:01 &lt;BogdanVancea> oh ;))
17:02 &lt;BogdanVancea> Why did you choose Solr as an alternative to ICE?
17:03 &lt;khodeir> has joined #ccm
17:03 &lt;BogdanVancea> and if you're busy with something, it's ok, I'll come back tomorrow :)
17:03 &lt;sdumitriu1> As it's said in the project description, ICE is not a very good choice for speed
17:04 &lt;sdumitriu1> It's good for size, since it compresses data very well
17:04 &lt;sdumitriu1> As to why Solr, we've had a good experience with it in PhenoTips, and before that we've been very happy with Lucene in other projects
17:04 &lt;BogdanVancea> I see :)
17:05 &lt;sdumitriu1> And if it can handle Wikipedia, it sure can handle a few genomes as well
17:05 &lt;BogdanVancea> I've used Solr for my Bachelor project, its awesome :)
17:05 &lt;BogdanVancea> Does Phenotips rely solely on Solr for persistence?
17:06 &lt;sdumitriu1> No
17:06 &lt;sdumitriu1> Just for indexing ontologies
17:07 &lt;sdumitriu1> It uses Hibernate over a RDBMS for the main storage
17:07 &lt;BogdanVancea> ah, I see
17:08 &lt;BogdanVancea> from what you've written in the project description for MedSavant, it sounded like you're considering using just Solr for persistence
17:11 &lt;sdumitriu1> Yes
17:11 &lt;sdumitriu1> Well, not only
17:11 &lt;sdumitriu1> Making a pluggable storage interface
17:12 &lt;sdumitriu1> So that we can switch between Solr, ICE or whatever we might implement
17:12 &lt;BogdanVancea> ah, I undestand
17:13 &lt;BogdanVancea> it sounds interesting :D
17:13 &lt;BogdanVancea> thanks for the answers
17:13 &lt;BogdanVancea> I'll head to sleep, it's past midnight in Romania
17:13 &lt;BogdanVancea> have a nice day
17:14 &lt;sdumitriu1> Good night
17:14 &lt;BogdanVancea> thanks
17:14 &lt;BogdanVancea> bye!
