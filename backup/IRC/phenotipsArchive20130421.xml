16:12 &lt;sdumitriu> Hm, why do you want to ignore travis?
16:12 &lt;kushalk124> Adain an error in my PR
16:13 &lt;sdumitriu> That one is good
16:13 &lt;sdumitriu> I mean, travis.yml shouldn't be ignored
16:13 &lt;sdumitriu> It's a valid configuration file
16:14 &lt;kushalk124> Its for our build
16:14 &lt;kushalk124> for testing
16:14 &lt;kushalk124> I thought we should ignore it
16:15 &lt;kushalk124> So with this GSOC project working on a new things
16:15 &lt;kushalk124> *thing
16:15 &lt;kushalk124> integrating TRAVIS and tweaking it
16:15 &lt;kushalk124> :)
16:15 &lt;sdumitriu> Well, .gitignore doesn't work like this
16:15 &lt;sdumitriu> Once the file is committed, it can't be ignored
16:15 &lt;sdumitriu> .gitignore is about files/directories that aren't already tracked by git and which should be ignored when listing new files
16:16 &lt;kushalk124> Oh yes
16:16 &lt;kushalk124> it should not be tracked
16:16 &lt;kushalk124> if I use git add .
16:16 &lt;kushalk124> it should not be added
16:16 &lt;sdumitriu> Why not?
16:17 &lt;sdumitriu> The file needs to be committed
16:17 &lt;kushalk124> Hmm
16:21 &lt;sdumitriu> kushalk124: The rule is that files that affect the project need to be committed; files that are specific to a computer shouldn't
16:21 &lt;kushalk124> Ohh
16:21 &lt;kushalk124> So it should be committed
16:21 &lt;sdumitriu> Yes
16:21 &lt;kushalk124> dependcy resolve failed
16:22 &lt;kushalk124> The command "mvn dependency:resolve -Dsilent -T2.0C" failed and exited with 1 during install.
16:22 &lt;sdumitriu> Hm, I wonder if on IRC it only reports failures on master
16:23 &lt;kushalk124> It can be configured to report errors for pull
16:28 &lt;kushalk124> sdumitriu: ?
16:29 &lt;sdumitriu> That's a false error...
16:29 &lt;sdumitriu> The dependency has been downloaded
16:30 &lt;kushalk124> It skipped many
16:30 &lt;kushalk124> Last 3
16:30 &lt;kushalk124> application interface
16:30 &lt;kushalk124> and others
16:30 &lt;sdumitriu> It's OK
16:31 &lt;sdumitriu> They skip whenever the build fails at an earlier stage
16:31 &lt;kushalk124> oh
16:31 &lt;kushalk124> What is the log size on jenkins server ?
16:33 &lt;sdumitriu> 148kb, 1791 lines
16:34 &lt;sdumitriu> But that's on a populated repository
16:34 &lt;kushalk124> Ohh
16:34 &lt;kushalk124> Any other way we can reduce the log
16:37 &lt;kushalk124> For the time we can use jenkins with https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub+Plugin
16:46 &lt;kushalk124> sdumitriu: ?

17:42 &lt;kushalk124> I think i should work on that issue tonight only
17:43 &lt;sdumitriu> Yeah, and I guess you should stop fixing issues for a while after that, otherwise there won't be any left for other students
17:44 &lt;kushalk124> :P
17:45 &lt;kushalk124> Do we need VM ?

18:01 &lt;kushalk124> Wait its trying to do
18:01 &lt;kushalk124> My net fails in between
18:01 &lt;kushalk124> with the new firewall
18:01 &lt;kushalk124> in campus
18:01 &lt;kushalk124> Connections break after sometime
18:04 &lt;kushalk124> You asked to pull from the remote 'upstream', but did not specify a branch. Because this is not the default configured remote for your current branch, you must specify a branch on the command line.
18:04 &lt;kushalk124> From what I know
18:04 &lt;kushalk124> If i go to upstream/master
18:05 &lt;kushalk124> I would be on a different head
18:09 &lt;kushalk124> sdumitriu:  ?
18:20 &lt;kushalk124> sdumitriu: there ?
18:21 &lt;kushalk124> Check the Last PR
