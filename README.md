This repository contains all the phenotips.org files, with a Maven configuration file for a standalone build.

**Notes**

Before committing please check:
- All user files are removed. Those are located in the XWiki folder (usually) and contain passwords.
- All references to ```jodatime``` are replaced by their XWiki counterpart.

- ```Home``` and ```Playground``` buttons are hardcoded to phenotips.org.
